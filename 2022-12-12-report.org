** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

This week, the v4 of our patchset containing an early version of gccrs was sent to the ~gcc-patches~ mailing list. This patchset contains files from around August, with many issues noted in the v1, v2 and v3 of the patches fixed. Almost immediately, the patchset was approved, which marks a huge milestone for the project.

Congratulations to all of the contributors, without whom we would never have made it this far this quickly. We still have a long road ahead of us, but we will get there!

1. Patches were sent
2. Patches were approved!
3. Touching up on a last few issues (trailing spaces, changelog...) and merging
4. We now need to figure out how to update the fucking thing

*** Milestones Progress

We plan on adding more fine-grained milestones in between November and April as more themes of work will become apparent.

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 66% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
