#+title:  Weekly report for 15th of May 2023 to 22nd of May 2023
#+author: Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen
#+date:   2023-05-22

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

A lot of work is being done on our AST pipeline in order to properly parse, expand and name-resolve the ~core~ crate, with multiple contributions coming from [[https://github.com/matthewjasper][Matthew Jasper]] and [[https://github.com/powerboat9][Arsen Owens]], two GitHub contributors. This is really nice to see and enables Arthur to keep working on derive macros. Regarding procedural macros, dynamic calls to shared libraries are being performed and tokens are being sent properly - what remains is to integrate the received tokens back into our AST, which is what Pierre-Emmanuel is currently working on.

We have also gotten in touch with our two GSoC students and are in the process of setting up weekly sessions with them to track their progress and communicate. Work on their projects will start on May 29th, per [[https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline][this year's GSoC timeline]]

*** Milestones Progress

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 73% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.

** Planned Activities

- Finish work on iterators
- Look into glob use statements
- Look into more builtin ~#[derive]~ macros
- Look into remaining issues required for proper AST pipeline of libcore
