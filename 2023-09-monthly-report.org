#+title:  Monthly Report for September 2023
#+author: Philip Herron, Pierre-Emmanuel Patry and Arthur Cohen
#+date:   2023-10-02

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

- 35 PRs merged, slowed down as expected + vacations + Cauldron
- Cleanups
- Focus on intrinsics
    - ~copy~
    - ~likely~
    - ~assume~
- Fix of cross compilation issues with ~libgrust~, re-enabling the usage of gccrs for the Dreamcast revival project
- Cauldron
    - Recording soon
    - Slides here:
    - Preparing slides
- patches sent upstream again
    - most of the focus this month
- will follow up with the 870 commits we are missing
- NR2.0 - only 18 test failures remaining, have to do with external crate importing
- Website contrast and theme changes

Finally, we are looking forward to meeting with the GCC community once again during GNU
Cauldron at the end of September in Cambridge. Philip and Pierre-Emmanuel will be giving
a talk about some of the recent changes in the compiler, as well as the inner workings of
procedural macros. We will also be talking about the compilation of the ~core~ library at
EuroRust in Brussels. See you then!

*** Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 9th of October 2023. You can subscribe to our calendar
to see when the next one will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just
like to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our [[https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust][mailing-list]] or join our [[https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com][Zulip chat]] to
be notified of upcoming events.
