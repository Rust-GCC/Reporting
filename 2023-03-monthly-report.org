*** Milestones Progress

We are putting together milestones regarding projects such as libproc and will update the Milestone.

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 69% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
Similarly, the Update GCC's master branch milestone contains a [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/issues/1705][tracking issue]] containing over 200 tasks. The percentage shown here takes this into account.

*** Risks

The last remaining risk was for gccrs to not get merged in GCC 13 by us missing the stage deadline, but that is no longer the case.

*** Testing project

The testing project is on hold as we try and figure out some of the issues we're running into with GitHub and our various automations around it.

** Planned Activities

- Finish patch upstreaming
- Finish macro name resolution
- libproc
- Iterators and Bugs
 
** Detailed changelog

*** Bare trait objects

During testing libcore code we found that we didn't support bare trait objects where it does not specify the 'dyn' keyword: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/edition-guide/rust-2021/warnings-promoted-to-error.html#bare_trait_objects

This is depreciated code but we aiming to compile older versions of libcore first so we need to be able to handle this before this became a hard error.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
trait Foo {
    fn bar(&mut self, other: &mut Foo);
}

struct Baz;
impl Foo for Baz {
    fn bar(&mut self, other: &mut Foo) {}
}
#+END_SRC

*** Reference patterns

One of our new contributors [[https://github.com/goar5670][Mahmoud Adel]] has been working on adding support for patterns within gccrs. Reference patterns was added recently which allows the users to automatically destructure the reference parameters here to their element types without requiring dereference syntax.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn foo (&a: &i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
  a + b
}
#+END_SRC

*** Use declarations as the Rustc prelude

When working with Result and Option gccrs did not support the prelude use declarations which meant you had to specify Option::Some or Result::Ok rather than the usual Ok and Some. In order to support this Rust uses a special decalration to add these enum variant names directly to the namespace so for exmaple:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
pub use result::Result::{self, Err, Ok};

extern "C" {
    fn printf(s: *const i8, ...);
}

mod result {
    pub enum Result<T, E> {
        #[lang = "Ok"]
        Ok(T),

        #[lang = "Err"]
        Err(E),
    }
}

pub fn test(a: i32) -> Result<i32, bool> {
    if a > 5 {
        Ok(123)
    } else {
        Err(false)
    }
}
#+END_SRC

Due to the use declaration it is now ok to directly use Err and Ok without specifying Result::<variant> directly.

*** Reanming our compiler proper from rust1 to crab1

This is an important change going forward to remember to have fun. For those who are not aware when you invoke gcc to compile C code fro example you should try doing so but pass the '-v' flag and you will see that it ends up invoking a program called 'cc1'. For gccrs we used to invoke one called rust1 we have now renamed this 'crab1'.

See our zulip for fun discussions on this and associated PR https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/1988

*** Add length checks for tuple patterns

When assigning tuples and patterns in general we did not have any sized checks so it used to be possible to assign a pattern of differing sizes which would lead to UB and or and ICE. Thanks to one of our new contributors [[https://github.com/nikos-alexandris][Nikos Alexandris]] we now have proper checks such as:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn foo() -> i32 { // { dg-error "expected .i32. got .bool." }
    let (a, _) = (true, 2, 3); // { dg-error "expected a tuple with 3 elements, found one with 2 elements" }
    a
}
#+END_SRC

see: https://godbolt.org/z/3njj6K14j

*** Uninit intrinsic

Although we add intrinsics fairly regularly this one is interesting from a compiler perspective, sometimes you just need uninitilized memory which is used in the mem::ptr modules in libcore which gets called from the iterator code to swap data around for the next element. We got some advice from bjorn3 here on our zulip which suggests the best way to implement an uninit intrinsic is to memset with 0x01 as it seems to be the least dangerous in an unsafe context.

  - https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/1948
  - https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/1899
  - https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/266897-general/topic/Rust.20uninit.20intrinsic/near/328521116

As rust is designed to limit unitilized memory it would be great in the future to look at this in more detail in the future for now we are copying Rustc.
