#+title:  Weekly report for the 11th to the 18th of March 2022

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

We have achieved a major step this week by merging the work required to get slices working. This long battle has exposed many flaws in our implementation of generics which have now been fixed, and is bringing us closer and closer to compiling an early version of the core Rust library. We are still going through a first dive into a privacy/visibility set of visitors, which will allow us to report privacy errors properly. Finally, we have also started looking into metadata exports which will allow us to use items from multiple crates compiled together. As a side note, our OSX support was broken and is now fixed thanks to a new contributor. The system has been added as a target to our CI to make sure it does not happen again.

** Detailed changelog

*** Slices support

TODO

*** More built-in macros

Our first builtin macro, ~cfg!~, has been moved with the rest of the builtin macros: It can now benefit from the other helper functions we have developed in this module to help consuming tokens and generating AST fragments. Two new macros have also been added:

1. ~concat!~, which allows the concatenation of literal tokens at compile-time

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
concat!("hey", 'n', 0, "w"); // expands to "heyn0w"
#+END_SRC

1. ~env!~, which allows fetching environment variables during compilation.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
let path = env!("PATH");
// expands to the content of the user's path when they invoked `gccrs`
#+END_SRC

~env!~ is interesting as it is one of the first built-in with an optional extra argument: You can specify an extra error message to display if the variable is not present.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
macro_rules! env {
    ($name:expr $(,)?) => { ... };
    ($name:expr, $error_msg:expr $(,)?) => { ... };
}
#+END_SRC

This enables us to start looking into properly checking for multiple "matchers" in builtins, and parse and fetch them accordingly.

A lot of built-in macros remain to implement, and we'd love for you to have a go at them if you're interested! Feel free to drop by our Zulip or ask on GitHub for any question you might have.
