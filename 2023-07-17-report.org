** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

1. Another 22 PRs this week
2. GSoC evaluations - both have been passed, flying colors, really good work
  1. Lots of contributions
3. Name resolution
  1. First pass finished, going to be merged
  2. Going to redo second pass and bring it to the same feature level as the existing EarlyNameResolver
  3. Then focus on proc macro name resolution with Pierre-Emmanuel
4. Lots of cleanups in the compiler, removing old abstractions from 2014

*** Milestones Progress

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 73% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
