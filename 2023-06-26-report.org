  2. New types
  3. Full rework from the ground up
  4. Data structure almost done, needs a clean-up and API improvements

2. One last bug for iterators
  1. Philip is working on that
3. proc macro statements
4. AST Dump improvements
5. HIR Dump
6. GSoC

*** Milestones Progress

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 73% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
