#+title:  Weekly report for 13th to 20th February 2023
#+author: Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen
#+date:   2023-02-20

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

The amount of contributions stayed very high this week with multiple pull-requests from multiple different people. Thank you! We are looking forward to more contributions from all of you.

The work on writing the Rust interface for our reimplementation of ~libproc~ was started by [[https://github.com/p-e-p/][Pierre-Emmanuel Patry]] and is ongoing. Once that interface is complete, Pierre-Emmanuel will get started on writing the C++ internals powering our ~libproc_macro~.
Philip kept working on various aspects of our type system such as bounds checking, and has restarted working on supporting ~for~ loops and the machinery that comes with them. Arthur spent most of his time working on various parser fixes and investigating macro name resolution internals.

We will also be writing Changelogs for the last few remaining commits that slipped through the cracks between our cutoff point in [[https://github.com/rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/1705][#1705]] and the time when we started enforcing Changelog in commits. There are only 22 commits left without a Changelog, so we expect this work to be dealt with quickly.
These commits will then be rebased on top of GCC's master branch and pushed.

As a reminder, we published 4 project ideas for this year's Google Summer of Code on GCC's wiki: https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SummerOfCode. You can see the list of projects in the ~Rust frontend~ section. Feel free to reach out on Zulip if you have any questions or would like to start putting together a proposal!

*** Milestones Progress

We plan on adding more fine-grained milestones in between November and April as more themes of work will become apparent.

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 69% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
Similarly, the Update GCC's master branch milestone contains a [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/issues/1705][tracking issue]] containing over 200 tasks. The percentage shown here takes this into account.
