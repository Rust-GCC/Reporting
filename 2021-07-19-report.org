#+title:  Weekly Report for 12th July to 19th July 2021
#+author: Philip Herron
#+date:   2021-19-12

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

Last week saw more building blocks being merged to enforce a trait's constraints onto an impl block. What [[https://github.com/bjorn3][bjorn3]] pointed out, which is pretty neat, is that a [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/565][super trait is syntatic sugar]] for a Self TypeParameter with a TypeBound of the super trait. This means we will reuse the same TypeBounding code to get this support for free so long as it is implemented correctly. 

All of this work is to tackle the optional trait items such as functions that will need my TypeBounding branch to do anything useful since a trait function item is pretty much a generic function with an implicit Self Type Parameter.

Throughout this Traits milestone, I've realised that many subtle things are going on in the rust compiler to implement it correctly. Most of all, a lot of this behaviour is just not documented. I think a complete language reference could address it, such as [[https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=1e194947a7390e90f86fe10604b4d386][method resolution rules]] that affect users of the language, not just compiler developers.

*** Google Summer of Code

Great progress for both students, thanks for all your hard work.

**** Cargo Support

[[https://github.com/CohenArthur][Arthur Cohen]] is still focused on the functional test harness work which is key to completing his GSoC goals. Apart from that he has been unifying the interfaces to support common options such as config printing, which includes adding support for enviroment variable arguments to the compiler such as GCCRS_EXTRA_ARGS etc.

**** Static Analysis

[[https://github.com/thomasyonug][Wenzhang Yang]] has completed all the goals of his GSoC proposal, so now he is blocked due to missing pattern matching for example. We have now scoped out further work to fix our unused variables/mutability scan. This fits well within his experience and should be achievable between now and the end of GSoC.

** Detailed changelog

*** Associated Type Errors

Extending from last week the placeholder types are not updated as part of the Trait impl block resolution so we can enforce rules where the TypePath to Self::A is properly enforced such as:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
trait Foo {
    type A;

    fn baz(a: Self::A) -> Self::A;
}

struct Bar<T>(T);

impl<T> Foo for Bar<T> {
    type A = i32;

    fn baz(a: f32) -> f32 {
        // { dg-error "expected .i32. got .f32." "" { target *-*-* } .-1 }
        // { dg-error "method .baz. has an incompatible type for trait .Foo." "" { target *-*-* } .-2 }
        a
    }
}

fn main() {
    let a;
    a = Bar::<i32>::baz(123f32);
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
test.rs:12:15: error: expected [i32] got [f32]
    4 |     fn baz(a: Self::A) -> Self::A;
      |               ~
......
   12 |     fn baz(a: f32) -> f32 {
      |               ^
test.rs:12:5: error: method ‘baz’ has an incompatible type for trait ‘Foo’
    4 |     fn baz(a: Self::A) -> Self::A;
      |     ~
......
   12 |     fn baz(a: f32) -> f32 {
      |     ^


#+END_SRC

*** Missing Trait Items within Impl Block

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
trait Foo {
    const A: i32;

    fn test(self);
}

struct Bar;
impl Foo for Bar {}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
test.rs:8:1: error: missing A, test in implementation of trait ‘Foo’
    2 |     const A: i32;
      |     ~
    3 | 
    4 |     fn test(self);
      |     ~
......
    8 | impl Foo for Bar {}
      | ^
#+END_SRC

Some items are optional and should not cause this error for example a function with a block this does not cause this error.

** Completed Activities
