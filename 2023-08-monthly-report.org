#+title:  Monthly Report for August 2023
#+author: Philip Herron, Pierre-Emmanuel Patry and Arthur Cohen

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

Another very important month in terms of contributions, with 86 pull requests merged. Once again, most of them come from the Google Summer of Code program, which is coming to an end.
You can expect more detailed blogposts about our students' work this summer in the coming weeks, but the short of it is: they have both been hugely successful, and have proved to be amazing contributors to the project. They have both passed the GSoC evaluations brillantly, and we are hoping they will keep working on the project!
Thank you [[https://github.com/tamaroning][Raiki Tamura]] and [[https://github.com/mahadmuhammad][Mahad Muhammad]]! Well done!

On the technical side of things, late name resolution is going swimmingly. We are now in
the process of merging it in the compiler, while still keeping it hidden behind a specific
command line flag (~-frust-name-resolution-2.0~). A lot of our existing testsuite passes
with that new option enabled, and we are working on fixing the remaining failures. Pierre-
Emmanuel has done some really good work on our early name resolution too, taking care of
transforming it into a fixed point algorithm which runs until nothing has changed. This
enables interesting behaviors, such as a macro invocation expanding to a macro definition,
which a later invocation could resolve to. Early name resolution is also responsible for
handling imports (~use~ declarations), and we are on track to add the last piece of the puzzle
needed for resolving *all* ~core~ 1.49 imports: glob imports (~use foo::*~). These imports
work differently from regular imports, as they only concern public items, and can be shadowed
by later declarations, but they are much easier to handle in our new name resolution algorithm
and are almost there.

This resolution pass also needs to tie in with the rest of the codebase, namely typechecking
and our compilation backend, which rely on it closely. We have spent a long amount of time
recreating the missing functions from those new data structures, and making sure the later
compilation passes could make use of the new resolution.

On the typechecking side, Philip is also getting infuriatingly close to getting iterators
working! Thanks to advice from [[https://github.com/bjorn3/][bjorn3]] and [[https://
github.com/matthewjasper][Matthew Jasper]], we have identified a few bugs in our handling of
compiler intrinsics, which are now fixed. The handling of opaque types is one of the last big
pieces of iterator support, which Philip is currently working on.

After that work is complete, we will start working on the ~format_args!()~ builtin macro, a central component of the widely used ~println!()~ macro as well as a lot of print-like macros available in Linux kernel.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
macro_rules! print_macro (
    // The non-continuation cases (most of them, e.g. `INFO`).
    ($format_string:path, false, $($arg:tt)+) => (
        // SAFETY: This hidden macro should only be called by the documented
        // printing macros which ensure the format string is one of the fixed
        // ones. All `__LOG_PREFIX`s are null-terminated as they are generated
        // by the `module!` proc macro or fixed values defined in a kernel
        // crate.
        unsafe {
            $crate::print::call_printk(
                &$format_string,
                crate::__LOG_PREFIX,
                format_args!($($arg)+),
            );
        }
    );

    // The `CONT` case.
    ($format_string:path, true, $($arg:tt)+) => (
        $crate::print::call_printk_cont(
            format_args!($($arg)+),
        );
    );
);

Finally, we are looking forward to meeting with the GCC community once again during GNU Cauldron at the end of September in Cambridge. Philip and Pierre-Emmanuel will be giving a talk about some of the recent changes in the compiler, as well as the inner workings of procedural macros. We will also be talking about the compilation of the ~core~ library at EuroRust in Brussels. See you then!

*** Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 11th of September 2023. You can subscribe to our calendar
to see when the next one will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just
like to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our [[https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust][mailing-list]] or join our [[https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com][Zulip chat]] to
be notified of upcoming events.
