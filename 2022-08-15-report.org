** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

Out GSoC project into porting C++ constexpr support has continued to progress well by finishing to support constant evaluation of builtin's which will be needed as part of handling overflow checks, now we need to focus on cleanup and merging back to main.

On the GCC Patches v2 front we have received some feedback that each patch does not need to be buildable as an independant unit and we should focus on making it easier to review interesting pieces of code. This will make this process much easier for us.

Overall we have made quite alot of progress in different ways this week from refactoring and cleanup to bugfixing and feature work.
