#+title:  Weekly report for the 2nd to the 9th of May 2022
#+author: Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen
#+date:   2022-05-09

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

We will soon be giving presentations and talks about Rust-GCC in various upcoming events, such as the [[https://live-embedded-event.carrd.co/][Live Embedded Event #3]] or [[https://www.embedded-world.de/en][Embedded World 2022]]. As a consequence, we spent a lot of time this week creating slides, organizing talks or making posters. Nonetheless, we kept progressing on our Imports and Visibility milestone: Philip kept fixing various bugs or oversights in the type system, bringing us closer and closer to compiling Rust's core library. Arthur kept working on visibilities, now allowing for the proper resolution of ~pub(restricted)~ items.

** Planned Activities

- Add more linting and restrictions to our privacy pass
- Continue bugfixing in aim of compiling our goal test case
- Continue work on metadata exports

** Detailed changelog

*** Match on boolean expressions

Thanks to [[https://github.com/dafaust][David Faust]], the compiler is now able to match on boolean expressions on top of patterns (which were already handled):

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
let a = false;

match a {
    true => { /* ... */ },
    false => { /* ... */ },
}
#+END_SRC

This adds reusable code for the remaining match arm possibilites to implement such as integers or strings.

*** pub(restricted) lints

As part of this milestone, it is important to resolve ~pub(restricted)~ items properly. ~pub(restricted)~ items refer to all items with a visibility modifier containing a path: This can be the often seen ~pub(crate)~ or more specific paths such as ~pub(in some::super::path)~.

These restrictions can only refer to valid modules that are ancestor modules:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
mod sain {
    mod doux {
	  mod graal { }

	  struct A0;

	  pub(in doux) struct A1; // valid
	  pub(in sain::doux) struct A2; // valid

	  pub(in sain::doux::A0) struct A3;
	  // valid path, invalid restriction! This is a type, not a module

	  pub(in sain::doux::graal) struct A4;
	  // valid path, invalid restriction! This is a child module, not a parent

	  pub(in not::exist::at_all) struct A5; // invalid path
    }
}
#+END_SRC

Note that we do not currently handle the differences betweens ~pub(restricted)~ in the 2015 and 2018 editions of the language: What we currently have is closer to the 2015 edition, and will keep on being worked on.

*** More compiler intrinsics

Thanks to the work done by [[https://github.com/liushuyu][liushuyu]], our backend keeps getting extended with new attributes and intrinsics. This week, the compiler gained support for ~breakpoint~, ~rotate_left~ and ~rotate_right~.
