#+title:  Weekly report for 3rd of April 2023 to 11th of April 2023
#+author: Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen
#+date:   2023-04-11

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

We have upstreamed more patches in preparation of the GCC 13.1 release, and will now be putting patch usptreaming on hold, as more and more of our commits depend on changes which we cannot push yet due to the current GCC development stage. Triaging all of these commits takes a large amount of time, and since we are unlikely to hit a major breakthrough functionality-wise (think `println!` or inline assembly working) before GCC 13.1 releases, this is unnecessary stress.
We are continuing our work on libcore and are getting through the remaining issues. We have created new milestones which are listed later in the report, and have reassigned some of our existing issues to them.

We had our community call on the 3rd of April 2023. You are able to find the meeting's minutes at the following link: https://hackmd.io/@Rust-GCC/SJmM4lJW2

*** Milestones Progress

We have added more milestones to the project to better compartimentalize the upcoming months of development.

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 69% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
