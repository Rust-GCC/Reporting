#+title:  Monthly Report for January 2023
#+author: Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

This month saw an influx of new contributors and pull-requests, which we are extremely happy about. We have opened multiple issues marked as ~good-first-pr~ in order to make sure that anyone interested in the project is able to get started.
Incidentally, this also caused us to start looking at enhancing the contributing experience regarding GCC ChangeLogs and restrictions earlier than planned. This is fine, as most of the infrastructure was already in place for our
work on upstreaming patches to GCC's master branch. Overall, more than 60 pull-requests were merged this month, with 8 new people contributing to the project!

As a consequence, our continuous integration now checks whether or not your commits contain the proper format of Changelog and respect the Digital Certificate of Origin or were made under an FSF copyright assignment. We are putting together more "interactive" to make
it easier for first time contributors to create these ChangeLog entries.

We also submitted our list of Google Summer of Code projects, which you can find [[https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SummerOfCode][here on the GCC wiki]], in the Rust frontend section. We put together four different projects, two of them being "short" (175 hours) and the rest being "long" (350 hours) projects.

The project also made the trip to FOSDEM at the beginning of February to give a talk to the Rust devroom about some internal workings of the compiler. You can find the recording of that talk [[https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/rust_a_deep_dive_inside_the_rust_frontend_for_gcc/][here, on the FOSDEM website]].

Finally, the most important news for the project this month is the arrival of [[https://github.com/P-E-P/][Pierre-Emmanuel Patry]] as a full time contributor to the project. Pierre-Emmanuel is joining us as part of his final year internship for his Masters degree, and will be mostly working on
our procedural macros. Notably, his work will consist in working on a reimplementation of ~libproc_macro~ as well as the various infrastructure surrounding that crate, such as inter process communication and client/server behavior within the compiler.

*** Community call

*** Milestones Progress

We are putting together milestones regarding projects such as libproc and will update the Milestone.

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 69% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
Similarly, the Update GCC's master branch milestone contains a [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/issues/1705][tracking issue]] containing over 200 tasks. The percentage shown here takes this into account.

*** Risks

The last remaining risk was for gccrs to not get merged in GCC 13 by us missing the stage deadline, but that is no longer the case.

*** Testing project

The testing project is on hold as we try and figure out some of the issues we're running into with GitHub and our various automations around it.

** Planned Activities

- Finish patch upstreaming
- Finish macro name resolution
- libproc
 
** Detailed changelog
