#+title:  Monthly Report for May 2023

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

The GCC 13.2 release date is approaching, and we are hard at work trying to get ~core~ integrated to ~gccrs~. We are progressing a lot on our AST pipeline, with many contributions from external contributors as well as work from Pierre-Emmanuel and Arthur. We are still trying to figure out some of the steps necessary for integrating the Rust 1.49 version of `core` with GCC's build system, and how to properly submit these patches upstream in time for reviewing.
This year's Google Summer of Code is also starting, with our two students getting started on their projects this week. This work will be happening in public on our GitHub repository and our Zulip chat, which you can join for updates.

We are also getting things ready for submitting a talk to EuroRust in October - if you have any subject you'd like us to talk about when we meet there, feel free to send us a message or email! The subject of the talk is not fully defined yet and we are open to all ideas.

*** Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 12th of June 2023. You can subscribe to our calendar
to see when the next one will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just
like to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our [[https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust][mailing-list]] or join our [[https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com][Zulip chat]] to
be notified of upcoming events.

*** Milestones Progress

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 73% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
Similarly, the Update GCC's master branch milestone contains a [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/issues/1705][tracking issue]] containing over 200 tasks. The percentage shown here takes this into account.

*** Testing project

The testing project is on hold as we try and figure out some of the issues we're running into with GitHub and our various automations around it.

** Planned Activities

- Look at remaining AST issues for compiling ~core~
- Fix remaining type systems bugs for ~core~ 1.49
- Look at procedural macro name resolution
- Look at moving imports name resolution to Early Name Resolver

** Detailed changelog
