** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

Philip and Arthur took some time this week to sort through this year's GSoC proposals and review them as well as rank them. We have landed on our final selection, and are now waiting to hear from Google. We look forward to working with you all over the summer and would like to thank you for the effort put into these proposals, as well as the very high number we received!

We have added new milestones to the project's repository in order to better split the upcoming months of work on the compiler, and are listing them below. We will keep pushing to get libcore compiling as soon as possible and look forward to the upcoming challenges!

*** Test Cases

The high amount of new testcases is due to the LTO testsuite issue mentioned in previous reports having been fixed by [[https://github.com/tschwinge][Thomas Schwinge]].

*** Milestones Progress

We have added more milestones to the project to better compartimentalize the upcoming months of development.

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 73% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.

| Milestone                         | Last Week | This Week | Delta | Start Date    | Completion Date | Target        |

*** Risks

** Planned Activities

- Finish work on iterators
- Look into glob use statements
- Look into remaining issues required for proper AST pipeline of libcore
