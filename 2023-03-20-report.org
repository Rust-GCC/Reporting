#+title:  Weekly report for 13th of March 2023 to 20th March 2023
#+author: Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen
#+date:   2023-03-06

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

1. Embedded World
2. Macro imports and exports almost complete
3. Iterators
4. Proc macro
5. Rename to crab1

The influx of contributors to the project has not stopped and we are constantly
getting pull-requests and interest from multiple people, which we are very
thankful for. A lot of people coming to chat with us on Zulip or asking to be
assigned to Github issues are planning to apply for this year's Google Summer
of Code, and as the GCC project has been accepted as a GSoC organization once
again, we are looking forward to all of your proposals! As a reminder,
you can find all of our project ideas [[https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SummerOfCode][on the GCC wiki]]. You are welcome to
come up with your own project idea too and discuss it with the team!

All of the contributors have tackled an important amount of issues this week, and we are quickly progressing through
our milestone.

On the ~libcore 1.49~ front, ~gccrs~ is getting really close to compiling ~for~ loops. This will be an important milestone,
as the amount of code from libcore necessary to get them to work is quite impressive. You can expect detailed changelogs from
Philip which will go into detail on all the interesting features and how we deal with them. Arthur has also spent time
tackling macro exports and imports, which are almost finished and just need a little cleaning-up.

Regarding ~libproc_macro~, Pierre-Emmanuel is working hard on getting GCC's build system to accomodate these new Rust libraries
as well as internal libraries which ~gccrs~ will make use of. He has also spent a lot of time going through our parser-related
issues, bringing us closer and closer to compiling the core library!

As a side-note, Arthur will be on vacation from the 3rd of March to the 10th of March, which is why this report is being written
as of today the 2nd of March. The monthly report will be published on the 13th of March.

Finally, ~gccrs~ will once again be at Embedded World in Nuremberg. Feel free to come to the Embecosm stand and discuss the project!

*** Milestones Progress

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 69% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
