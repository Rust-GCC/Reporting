** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

- Last upstream batch last monday, went well
  - Now onto regularly scheduled upstreaming every monday
  - One coming this afternoon
- Closing out one big milestone about bringing minimum required Rust version to 1.49
  - Enables testing on old repositories and much older systems
  - Also brings us closer to compiling our own Rust code
- 29 pull requests this week, mostly bugfixes by Philip which is very nice
