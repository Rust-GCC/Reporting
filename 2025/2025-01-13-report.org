** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

- Lots of work on three milestones at the moment, close to having them finished
  - Auto traits
  - Remaining built-in derive macros
  - More lang item stuff
  - A lot of type system and codegen fixes by Philip
  - Some more name resolution fixes
- Will then switch to error propagation expressions which are a big hurdle in core/std

*** Risks

We have now entered Stage 3 of GCC development, and all of the patches we needed to get upstreamed have been upstreamed. The risk present in this table is no longer present.

| Risk                                          | Impact (1-3) | Likelihood (0-10) | Risk (I * L) | Mitigation                                                      |

** Planned Activities

- Finish all built-in derive macros
- Start work on error propagation expression
- Continue fixing remaining failing test for name resolution 2.0
