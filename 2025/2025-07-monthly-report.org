** Planned Activities

- Start working on try blocks and while-let loops
- Finish name resolution and macro expansion issues

*** Risks

We must establish the list of GCC-common changes we need, as we will have to send them upstream before the start of Stage 3 around November. This is the only risk which could incur further problems and prevent more gccrs features from landing in 16.1.
