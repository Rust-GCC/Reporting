** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

- 10 PRs merged this week, very productive week
- Advancements on all three milestones that were mentionned
- Error Propagation operator milestone almost completed but not merged
  - All of the lang items are set in place
  - Waiting on fixing one bug in our backend which culls the generated nodes
  - There are also two typechecker issues holding us back a little
- One massive PR is also in review which will almost get us all the way to for-loops and error propagation operator
- Fixes to our built-in derive macros when implemented on generic types
- More name resolution 2.0 fixes, including closure capture feature which is essential
- Progress on the black_box intrinsic as well

*** Risks

We have now entered Stage 3 of GCC development, and all of the patches we needed to get upstreamed have been upstreamed. The risk present in this table is no longer present.

All the key risks have been addressed, this is just about getting as many features implemented as possible

| Risk                                          | Impact (1-3) | Likelihood (0-10) | Risk (I * L) | Mitigation                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------+--------------+-------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing features for GCC 15.1 deadline        |            2 |                 0 |            0 | Start working on required features as early as July (6mo ahead) |

** Planned Activities

- Finish all built-in derive macros
- Finish work on error propagation expression
- Finish implementation of black_box intrinsic
- Continue fixing remaining failing test for name resolution 2.0
