#+title:  Monthly Report for April 2025
#+author: Philip Herron, Pierre-Emmanuel Patry and Arthur Cohen
#+date:   2025-05-05

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Project update

In the last two weeks of development, we have managed to upstream all of our required commits and get ready for the 15.1 release. We are now working on fixes we would like to see included in the 15.2 release this summer, as well as more technical features we hope to land in 15.2.

We will be writing a 15.1 retrospective blogpost, which will go in more details on all the features we managed to get in this release. We will also establish a milestones document for 16.1, like we had done last year for 15.1.

However, most of our time in the next week or so will be dedicated to writing our talk for [[https://dev.events/conferences/rust-week-2025-utcccotp][RustWeek 2025]]. Pierre-Emmanuel and Arthur were selected to give a talk after all, as some of the speakers could not make it to the event.
We have also submitted a talk to [[https://oxidizeconf.com/][Oxidize 2025]], where we hope to interact with people in the Embedded Systems industry. Finally, we will also be submitting a talk to EuroRust 2025, to continue our presentations on the state of ~gccrs~ and how close it is to compiling the Rust standard library and Rust-for-Linux code.

*** Community call

Having a community call this month will be difficult, as Pierre-Emmanuel and Arthur will be traveling to the Netherlands next week on Monday the 12th.

** Planned Activities

- Merge fixes in 15.2
- Continue working towards getting more features in 15.2

*** Risks

We must establish the list of GCC-common changes we need, as we will have to send them upstream before the start of Stage 3 around November. This is the only risk which could incur further problems and prevent more gccrs features from landing in 16.1.
