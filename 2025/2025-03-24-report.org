** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

- We have upstreamed all of our patches to GCC in time for 15.1
- 576 commits in total, spread accross 4 batches to avoid spamming the ML and allow for some testing of the intermediary steps
- No massive failures to report, only issue came from the Rust build system attempting to download external libraries in an offline build environment after the first batch, which was resolved promptly before the second batch
- Now the goal is to upstream commits every week on mondays until the actual release
- 12 PRs merged this week, which makes it a quite productive week
  - All commits from these PRs already upstreamed this morning
