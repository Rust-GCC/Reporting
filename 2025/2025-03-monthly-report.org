#+title:  Monthly Report for March 2025

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Project update

74 pull-requests were merged this month, with multiple internal compiler error fixes thanks to the fuzzing work done by [[https://github.com/matthiaskrgr][Matthias Kr√ºger]], which helped expose multiple invalid code paths in the compiler. Thank you!

We also spent some time getting our mininum supported Rust version down to Rust 1.49 for our Rust components. As a reminder, Rust 1.49 is the version that ~gccrs~ currently targets, and getting our own Rust components compilable with this version also means getting closer and closer to ~gccrs~ compiling its own components - an objective we will pursue as soon as we are able to compile the Rust standard library. This also enables for more testing on less common systems, as certain versions of Darwin or Ubuntu still in use by our community only have access to older Rust installations.

We are still working on developing new features and upstreaming them in time for the GCC 15.1 release. The cutoff date for the branch is yet to be announced, but should happen soon. We have continued work on our milestones, and have spent a lot of time getting further and further into the compilation of ~core~. This opened new issues on the project with our macro expansion and name resolution, which we quickly fixed in the last few weeks.

One of the focus of this month was adding support for the ~min_specialization~ feature, which you can learn more about [[https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1210-impl-specialization.md][here]]. In its current form, ~gccrs~ only supports a subset of ~min_specialization~, which itself is a subset of ~specialization~ in general. We are required to support parts of this feature as it used in ~core~ to improve runtime performance in certain cases.

For example, the machinery responsible for implementing [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.zip][Iterator::zip]] (as a reminder, ~Iterator::zip~ enables you to tie together two iterators and advance them as the same time) lives in the ~core::iter::adapters::ZipImpl~ trait, whose definition looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust

// Zip specialization trait
#[doc(hidden)]
trait ZipImpl<A, B> {
    type Item;
    fn new(a: A, b: B) -> Self;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
    fn size_hint(&self) -> (usize, Option<usize>);
    fn nth(&mut self, n: usize) -> Option<Self::Item>;
    fn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>
    where
        A: DoubleEndedIterator + ExactSizeIterator,
        B: DoubleEndedIterator + ExactSizeIterator;
    // This has the same safety requirements as `Iterator::__iterator_get_unchecked`
    unsafe fn get_unchecked(&mut self, idx: usize) -> <Self as Iterator>::Item
    where
        Self: Iterator + TrustedRandomAccess;
}
#+END_SRC

If we keep reading through the file, we can see two implementations for this trait:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust

impl<A, B> ZipImpl<A, B> for Zip<A, B>
where
    A: Iterator,
    B: Iterator,
{ /* ... */ }

// and ...

#[doc(hidden)]
impl<A, B> ZipImpl<A, B> for Zip<A, B>
where
    A: TrustedRandomAccess + Iterator,
    B: TrustedRandomAccess + Iterator,
{ /* ... */ }
#+END_SRC

In one case, the implementation is more specialized and adds an extra bound - ~TrustedRandomAccess~. Without specialization, these two implementations are ambiguous, as they contain similar bounds. But by using specialization, the ~core~ library is able to provide a default, safe and slower implementation of ~zip~ while also providing a fast one where possible, for example if the iterators support trusted random access, meaning it supports efficent and safe random index accesses.

The method ~next~ for these two implementations of ~ZipImpl~ thus look like the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust

impl<A, B> ZipImpl<A, B> for Zip<A, B>
where
    A: Iterator,
    B: Iterator,
{
    #[inline]
    default fn next(&mut self) -> Option<(A::Item, B::Item)> {
        let x = self.a.next()?;
        let y = self.b.next()?;
        Some((x, y))
    }
}

// and...

impl<A, B> ZipImpl<A, B> for Zip<A, B>
where
    A: TrustedRandomAccess + Iterator,
    B: TrustedRandomAccess + Iterator,
{
    #[inline]
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<(A::Item, B::Item)> {
        if self.index < self.len {
            let i = self.index;
            self.index += 1;
            // SAFETY: `i` is smaller than `self.len`, thus smaller than `self.a.len()` and `self.b.len()`
            unsafe {
                Some((self.a.__iterator_get_unchecked(i), self.b.__iterator_get_unchecked(i)))
            }
        } else if A::may_have_side_effect() && self.index < self.a.size() {
            // match the base implementation's potential side effects
            // SAFETY: we just checked that `self.index` < `self.a.len()`
            unsafe {
                self.a.__iterator_get_unchecked(self.index);
            }
            self.index += 1;
            None
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}
#+END_SRC

In the more specific method, the behavior is the same, but the implementation makes use of extra type information to provide faster runtime performance when selecting the next items to iterate on. With the work done this month, ~gccrs~ is now able to select these faster methods without producing an "ambiguous method resolution" error. While specialization is not used in Rust-for-Linux, it is important that we are able to resolve to the same methods as ~rustc~ when compiling code. This will also make for more optimized binaries and a faster kernel once we are able to compile Rust-for-Linux. In order to fully support ~min_specialization~ however, we would need to implement a new algorithm for deciding between two ~default~ functions and choosing the most specific one, which would require the development of a new decision tree and the associated algorithms. This is not required for ~core~ or Rust-for-Linux, and will thus be worked on at a later date.

** Planned Activities

- Finish ~derive(PartialOrd)~ and ~derive(PartialEq)~ implementation
- Finish let-else compilation
- Upstream changes up to the release point

*** Risks

We have now entered Stage 3 of GCC development, and all of the patches we needed to get upstreamed have been upstreamed. The risk that were outlined here are no longer present, and we are focusing on getting as many features implemented and upstreamed as possible.
