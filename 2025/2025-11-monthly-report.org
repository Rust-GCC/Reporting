** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Project update

We have made good progress on compiling Rust-for-Linux with a first few PRs aimed at compiling Generic Associated Types. These types are unstable in Rust 1.49, and not present in ~core~, but required for compiling the kernel crates. Regarding ~core~, we have made progress on multiple name resolution issues and are now going much further in the pipeline. Only a few late name resolution issues remain, which we intend to fix shortly.

Our upstreaming process is now well ironed out, with weekly upstreams to GCC. This has led to an increase in reviews and interactions from the GCC side of the community which is very welcome! Having a more regular upstream schedule also helped with fixing some bootstrapping issues more quickly, which were introduced due to changes in the C++ frontend.

We are busy working away at the issues for Rust-for-Linux, and hope to be able to compile the kernel soon. We will try to present this work at multiple conferences in 2026, and we hope to have some good news! The goal is for the Rust front-end of GCC 16.1 to be able to compile the kernel and most 1.49 Rust code, and we are on track to complete this objective.

*** Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 8th of December at 10am UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our [[https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust][mailing-list]] or join our [[https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com][Zulip chat]] to be notified of upcoming events.
