** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Project update

Most of the time this month was dedicated to preparing and attending three conferences: Oxidize in Berlin, Kangrejos in Oviedo and GNU Cauldron in Porto. Pierre-Emmanuel and Arthur also started working on another project for Embecosm, thus reducing the time spent on ~gccrs~ this month.

Oxidize was a nice experience and a good way to meet with some people using Rust in the embedded industry. We were able to present the project to many people who had not heard of it, and show the advantages of using the GCC static analyzers on unsafe Rust code.

Kangrejos was a great way for Pierre-Emmanuel to meet with a lot of folks working on the Linux kernel. A lot of them expressed interest in our progress, and a few mentioned their personal requirement for sticking with a GCC toolchain for compiling the kernel.

In Porto for Cauldron, a lot of GNU folks were interested in the frontend's experimental status and the projects' roadmap. There were comments about removing the dependency on ~cargo~ and ~rustc~, which we are currently working towards with our goal of getting the standard library to compile under ~gccrs~.

On that point, the entirety of ~core~ was added as a testcase to our testsuite - we are slowly but surely getting it to go through more and more passes of our pipeline. There is currently one bug left for our entire pipeline to pass, which concerns the resolution of const items associated with built-in types, such as ~i8::MAX~.

After communicating with the GCC release managers, we have also worked on implementing a new CI process whose goal is to send emails to the GCC mailing list for each commit merged in our development repository. This will allow GCC developers to review patches as they are merged upstream, instead of seeing them in batches every week when we upstream them.

*** Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 15th of October at 9am UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our [[https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust][mailing-list]] or join our [[https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com][Zulip chat]] to be notified of upcoming events.
