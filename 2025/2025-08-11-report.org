** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

- Fixes to our attribute parser are in
  - This helps with some of the missing features and attributes for core
- Macro expansion fixes are being worked on and almost complete
- Sync with upstream + Sent 200 patches upstream and now resuming regular upstreaming
- offset_of!() milestone completed
