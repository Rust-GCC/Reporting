** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

- Preparing talks for Kangrejos and Oxidize
- Leaving Tuesday morning for PE and Arthur, coming back on Thursday night for Arthur - PE stays away for Cauldron
- Good progress done on core last week with prelude resolution working, so resolving special items from anywhere - like a special module always in scope
  - Also have a prototype for prelude injection, when there is no prelude defined - use the standard library one. Not necessary for now but necessary for Rust-for-Linux
- Work also a bit slowed down because of other Embecosm project

** Completed Activities
