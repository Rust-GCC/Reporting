#+title:  Monthly Report for October 2025
#+author: Philip Herron, Pierre-Emmanuel Patry and Arthur Cohen
#+date:   2025-11-10

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Project update

We have started experimenting with compiling Rust-for-Linux, as planned in our last monthly reports, and we are happy to report very few issues apart from the ones related to requiring a functional ~core~ crate. We then created a new Rust-for-Linux milestone to gather all the missing functionality required for compiling the Rust parts of the kernel, and are still collecting issues.

Work on this will continue in parallel with the last few reminaing bugfixes for ~core~. However, due to other Embecosm projects, Pierre-Emmanuel and Arthur did not have enough time in November to complete these few remaining bugs.

In other news, our two french interns are progressing really fast and will soon beging contributing to complete milestones for certain unhandled features required for Rust-for-Linux and further existing Rust code. They are very proficient and greatly help the team with the issues they tackle. For now, they are focusing on non-critical parts of the pipeline such as emitting warnings in certain conditions and fixing Internal Compiler Errors.

We have ironed out our upstreaming processes and now rebase gccrs on top of trunk regularly. Similarly, it is really easy for us to update trunk with our latest gccrs changes, which we are currently sending upstream once a week. This caused a few pain points when bootstrapping due to existing issues in the C++ frontend, but they are now resolved.

Thanks to the work from Marc Poulhies, our CI now sends emails to the GCC Patches mailing list for each commit merged in our development repository on github. This makes it easy for GCC hackers to interact with our Rust frontend and review patches as they come in. We have been testing the system for a month now, and Marc has ironed out the kinks, meaning it will be deployed on the 10th of November after a message explaining the steps on the GCC mailing lists.

*** Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 17th of November at 10am UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our [[https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust][mailing-list]] or join our [[https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com][Zulip chat]] to be notified of upcoming events.
