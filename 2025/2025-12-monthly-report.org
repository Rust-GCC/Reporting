** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Project update

This last report of the year 2025 

For the last month of 2025, we have once again made good progress on our name resolution algorithm in the hopes of getting ~core~ further along our compilation pipeline. We have not necessarily focused on the kernel itself this month, as most of the team was away on vacation for half of the month. The entire early name resolution and macro expansion fixed-point is now complete for ~core~, which is a massive milestone for the project - it is actually the reason why we decided to rewrite name resolution from scratch a couple of years ago. We are now able to handle all of the complex imports and exports in ~core~, coupled with the extensive amount of macros used for various primitive implementations. This leads us to the second half of the problem, late name resolution, which is currently still not finished for ~core~. This holiday season, we have fixed four massive bugs which impacted ~core~ as well as complex Rust crates. There are still a few issues with our late name resolution, namely around certain vectorized types and methods not being found, but nothing too drastic or hard to fix.

Other technical improvements include the work done by our two interns, [[https://github.com/Villosse][Lenny Chiadmi Delage]] and [[https://github.com/lucasly-ba][Lucas Ly Ba]], who have greatly improved various lints in the compiler focused on correctness and safety. January marks our last month with them, and we will greatly miss them and their contributions!

We will continue working on these late name resolution issues for the first few weeks of 2026, and will hopefully be able to quickly switch to our middle-end and backend issues for ~core~ - which there shouldn't be much of. Once name resolution passes, we will be able to split our focus between ~core~ and the kernel, figuring out what issues show up once the kernel correctly depends on ~core~. As explained before, the goal is for gccrs to be able to compile ~core~ and the kernel before RustConf and EuroRust in September, two conferences where we hope to present the work done on the compiler these last two years.

The CFPs for these conferences is almost open, which means we are also spending some of our time working on our abstracts. We want to maximize our chances of the talks getting accepted, as these two conferences could be the most important talks we've ever given for the project!

Finally, our upstreaming is still going strong, as we are sticking to our schedule and uploading commits weekly. We are up to date with the latest GCC, which is also up to date with our development branch.

*** Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 12th of January at 10am UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our [[https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust][mailing-list]] or join our [[https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com][Zulip chat]] to be notified of upcoming events.
