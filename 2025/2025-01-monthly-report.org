*** Project update

47 pull requests merged since last month

This month of development was focused on three major milestones of compiler development: auto traits, built-in macros and for-loops, which are all important in order to compile ~core 1.49~ and later, the Rust-for-Linux project.

The most widely known auto traits in Rust may be [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/send-and-sync.html][Send and Sync]], which are used all throughout the Rust standard library to indicate thread-safety. As such, these traits are often used in trait-bounds to restrict sharing behavior to thread-safe objects:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
trait Foo {
    fn foo(&self);
}

struct Safe;

// We cannot send pointers safely between threads
struct NonThreadSafe(*const i32);

impl Foo for Safe { fn foo(&self) { } }
impl Foo for NonThreadSafe { fn foo(&self) { } }

fn take_foo(foo: &(dyn Foo)) {
    foo.foo();
}

fn take_thread_safe_foo(foo: &(dyn Foo + Send + Sync)) {
    foo.foo();
}

fn main() {
    let s = Safe;
    
    let i = 15;
    let n_s = NonThreadSafe(&i as *const i32);
    
    take_foo(&s);
    take_foo(&n_s);
    
    take_thread_safe_foo(&s);
    take_thread_safe_foo(&n_s);
}
#+END_SRC

which errors out with the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust

Part of our pipeline was lacking support for these automatic trait bounds, which now enables us to build this code properly. Two missing features remain for properly handling these special bounds:

1. Additional trait bounds can only be automatic traits

We have to restrict the usage of additional trait bounds to auto traits exclusively, as ~rustc~ does:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn takes_only_clone_copy_and_fromstr(a: &(dyn Clone + Copy + FromStr)) {}
#+END_SRC

will give out the following error:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
error[E0225]: only auto traits can be used as additional traits in a trait object
  --> src/main.rs:16:55
   |
16 | fn takes_only_clone_copy_and_fromstr(a: &(dyn Clone + Copy + FromStr)) {}
   |                                               -----   ^^^^ additional non-auto trait
   |                                               |
   |                                               first non-auto trait
   |
   = help: consider creating a new trait with all of these as supertraits and using that trait here instead: `trait NewTrait: Clone + Copy + FromStr {}`
   = note: auto-traits like `Send` and `Sync` are traits that have special properties; for more information on them, visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/special-types-and-traits.html#auto-traits>
#+END_SRC

https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/error_codes/E0225.html

We must add additional logic to our typechecker in order to check for these bounds, and make sure that the additional bounds we resolve to only refer to auto traits - otherwise, error out with an appropriate error message. This isn't a terribly difficult feature to add, but it does require a bit of experience with our type system.

2. Implementing Send and Sync properly

Finally, we must implement the ~Send~ and ~Sync~ traits properly, and auto traits in general, so that they are applied automatically unless you opt out of it. One major difficulty comes from having to automatically opt-out types that contains other opted-out types, like in the following example:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
#![feature(auto_traits)]
#![feature(negative_impls)]

auto trait MegaAuto {}

struct S;

impl !MegaAuto for S {}

struct S_Wrap(S);

fn take_mega_auto(a: &dyn MegaAuto) {}

fn main() {
    let a = S;
    let b = S_Wrap(S);
    
    take_mega_auto(&a);
    take_mega_auto(&b);
}
#+END_SRC

which errors out with the following information:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust

error[E0277]: the trait bound `S: MegaAuto` is not satisfied
  --> src/main.rs:18:20
   |
18 |     take_mega_auto(&a);
   |                    ^^ the trait `MegaAuto` is not implemented for `S`
   |
   = note: required for the cast from `&S` to `&dyn MegaAuto`

error[E0277]: the trait bound `S: MegaAuto` is not satisfied in `S_Wrap`
  --> src/main.rs:19:20
   |
19 |     take_mega_auto(&b);
   |                    ^^ within `S_Wrap`, the trait `MegaAuto` is not implemented for `S`
   |
note: required because it appears within the type `S_Wrap`
  --> src/main.rs:10:8
   |
10 | struct S_Wrap(S);
   |        ^^^^^^
   = note: required for the cast from `&S_Wrap` to `&dyn MegaAuto`
#+END_SRC

This will be a lot more involved, and will require important changes to our type system.

The rest of the month was focused on for-loops and built-in derive macros, which first required a major refactor of our AST and HIR. The problem is as follows: for-loops desugar using the following pattern:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
for <pattern> in <iterator> {
  <body>
}

// becomes

{
    let result = match ::std::iter::IntoIterator::into_iter(<iterator>) {
        mut iter => {
            loop {
                let mut __next;
                match ::std::iter::Iterator::next(&mut iter) {
                    ::std::option::Option::Some(val) => __next = val,
                    ::std::option::Option::None => break
                };
                let <pattern> = __next;
                <body>;
            }
        }
    };
    result
}
#+END_SRC

The paths used in this desugaring are a bit special, as they all start with a leading ~::~. [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/paths.html#path-qualifiers][This is used to indicate that the first path segment should refer to an external crate, and that the path should resolve in one of these crates]]. This is very useful to prevent ambiguity: If a user were to define their own ~std~ module, with an inner ~option~ module and an ~Option~ enum, simply using the ~std::option::Option~ path would resolve to this instead of the expected standard enum.

If for some reason this user-defined enum were to be different, the desugared code would not work, and you would end up with cryptic errors. But since the path is required to resolve in the extern crate ~std~, there are no issues. /However/, ~gccrs~ cannot yet compile the standard library, or distribute it and link it to each program being compiled. Meaning that we would never be able to resolve those paths, at least until we get to compile the standard library. But the standard library contains for-loops, so we're in a real pickle.

Thankfully, those specific paths used for desugars or macro expansions often refer to specific items that the compiler knows about: [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/unstable-book/language-features/lang-items.html][lang items]]. By instead using "lang item paths", we can refer to these specific items and enum variants to properly desugar our for-loops. But these paths are extremely different from regular, segmented paths, and required a big refactor of both our AST and HIR. Which then allowed us to almost complete the desugaring of for-loops, and improve our handling of built-in macros - another kind of compiler expansion that makes use of lang items you probably already know about, such as ~Copy~ or ~Clone~.

We still have a few built-in derives to properly implement in order to support all of them, and close out the ~Macro expansion~ milestone of the project. These built-in derives are used all throughout ~std~, and throughout most Rust code, meaning they are essential for compiling the Rust standard library.

** Planned Activities

- Implement remaining built-in derive macros
- Implement Send and Sync auto traits
- Finish for-loops code expansion
- Improve our process for updating our github repository with upstream GCC

*** Risks

We have now entered Stage 3 of GCC development, and all of the patches we needed to get upstreamed have been upstreamed. The risk present in this table is no longer present.

| Risk                                          | Impact (1-3) | Likelihood (0-10) | Risk (I * L) | Mitigation                                                      |
