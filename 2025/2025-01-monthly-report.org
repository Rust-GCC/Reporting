** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Project update

- 47 pull requests merged since last month
- Work on all these milestones
  - Lang items -> for-loops, question mark operator
  - Question mark operator
    - Two Missing type inference issues, which are being worked on by Philip, and then this is done
  - For loops
  - Auto traits
  - built-in derive macros
    - Specifically on these following macros:
      - Default
        - Required for Rust-for-Linux modules, e.g. the ModuleInfo struct
        https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/rust-next/rust/macros/module.rs
      - PartialEq, Eq
        - required for compiling RfL's implementation of the kernel memory allocation infrastructure
        https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/rust-next/rust/kernel/alloc.rs
  - black box intrinsics
    - Required for compiling core, bench, test, rustc testsuite
  - name resolution 2.0
  - for-loops are working! which seems really cringe but requires
    - hindley milner type inference
    - proper lang item path resolving
      - which required a full rework of our entire AST and HIR path classes, which affect almost every class in the compiler

** Planned Activities

- Implement remaining built-in derive macros
- Improve our process for updating our github repository with upstream GCC

*** Risks

We have now entered Stage 3 of GCC development, and all of the patches we needed to get upstreamed have been upstreamed. The risk that were outlined here are no longer present, and we are focusing on getting as many features implemented and upstreamed as possible.
