#+title:  Monthly Report for May 2025

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Project update

The past month of development was mostly focused on community outreach, with a talk from Pierre-Emmanuel and Arthur at RustWeek in Utrecht, available [[https://www.youtube.com/live/3clGDj1QR6A?si=hMnbr2QOveW1EIDa&t=18393][here]]. Here, we met with Miguel Ojeda from the Rust-for-Linux project, who informed us that the kernel no longer relies on the ~alloc~ standard crate for its function. This makes our job easier, as we are now tasked with compiling ~core~ and the kernel's implementation of ~alloc~, rather than having to catch up with the standard library's ~alloc~ crate.

In practice, this means that ~gccrs~ should be useful for Rust-for-Linux in a shorter span of time than originally planned, and we will start integrating the kernel's source code to our testing infrastructure in our efforts to target those crates. We spent some time last month establishing these milestones, which will be worked on as part of a further 6 months of support from [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]], until the end of Stage 1 for GCC 16.1.

As such, the next milestones will be divided like so:

**** `core` support

- Look into what is missing in `core`
- Some nameres stuff
- Some macro expansion stuff?
- Some derive macros?
- Some pattern matching stuff

We need to first finish name resolution as we still have a lot of unresolved imports when compiling `core`.

**** RfL support

- Start running `gccrs` on the `rust/kernel/lib.rs` crate
- We need to look at `Pin` as that is used a *lot* in RfL - and it probably needs some compiler support
  - pin_init
  - pin_init_from_closure
  - PinInit trait
  - a lot of stuff returns `impl PinInit<...>` so we need to finish RPIT first
  - and also `RPITIT` since that is used in `InPlaceModule` trait for example
- We need `offset_of!()`
- We need proper inline assembly support

Work also continued on the name resolution rewrite, which is now frustratingly close to replacing our previous implementation. We are resuming work on all areas of the compiler in June. The project received contributions from the usual suspects, with around 25 pull requests from external contributors this month. We are also starting work with our two GSoC students, Zhi Heng and Ryutaro Okada. They will be working on improving our pattern matching backend and on reimplementing certain Rust lints within our front-end rather than by depending on the GCC common compiler framework.

** Planned Activities

- Merge fixes in 15.2
- Continue working towards getting more features in 15.2

*** Risks

We must establish the list of GCC-common changes we need, as we will have to send them upstream before the start of Stage 3 around November. This is the only risk which could incur further problems and prevent more gccrs features from landing in 16.1.
