** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

- Oxidize
- Kangrejos
- Progess on prelude name resolution, with one tiny bug remaining
- If that bug is fixed, we can start working on Rust-for-Linux
