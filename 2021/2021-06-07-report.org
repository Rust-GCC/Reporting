** Overview
Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

This is a quiet week for GCC Rust, as I was on vacation for my 33rd Birthday. The implementation focus is now onto cleanup of the HIR structures, and for a way to represent the trait definition and self on traits. The next set of changes for traits are difficult and are likely to live on my local branch for most of this week in order to get enough testing done to avoid any regressions.

*** Google Summer of Code

**** Cargo Support

[[https://github.com/CohenArthur][Arthur Cohen]] has a [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/cargo-gccrs/pull/5][PR]] which is close to being ready which is the initial concept to allow cargo to build rust code: 

**** Static Analysis

[[https://github.com/thomasyonug][Wenzhang Yang]] is continuing to fix up his [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/491][open PR]] on creating a way of implementing attributes within the compiler.
