** Overview

*** Milestone Progress

As part of my on going work into generics this milestone breaks down into 3 major pieces of work:

- ADT (algebraic data type) with generic params
- Function with generic params
- Impl blocks with generic param

The first piece is in and merged the 2nd one is an open PR over on [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/297][PR297]]. This implements recursive generics and generic functions. The branch is currently being cleaned up before it will be merged. This has been an effort of several weeks to get right. Aside from these three pieces of work there are smaller tasks in generics in terms of parameter binding which will be done once these sub taksare done first.

*** Open PRs

The project has recieved many contributions which has been very exciting, but as this project is destined to be upstream with GCC we do have to follow the rules with regards to copyright assignment (https://gcc.gnu.org/contribute.html). There are several PR's that have been stalled waiting for copyright assignment namely:

- Testsuite updates: [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/301][PR301]]
- Refactor UnitType to reuse empty TupleType like Rustc: [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/286][PR286]]
- Fix crash on zero length arrays: [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/288][PR288]]

** Completed Activities

- Fix default of decimal numbers to f64 instead of f32 - [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/294][PR294]]
- Fix type resolution on inference variables in final expressions - [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/298][PR298]]
- Cleanup the overloaded-virtual build warnings - [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/287][PR287]]
