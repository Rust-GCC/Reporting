* Weekly Report 4th Jan to 11th Jan

This was the first week back since the Christmas vacation, it was good to
get back into Rust. The focus was making sure the name resolver was working
correctly by creating an unused name pass which threw up some bugs which had
to be resolved on the way.

Implicit Returns was the other big focus and with the help from @bjorn3 it helped
me understand fully the implementation rustc has made. The paticular case in question
was:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn test() -> i32 {
    if x > 1 {
        5
    } else {
        0
    }
    123
}
#+END_SRC

This test case demonstrates that Rust treats the final last expression as the result of the function.
Which means the if block is treated as a statement which should be unit type. Though if you were to remove
the final expression of 123 this is now valid.
