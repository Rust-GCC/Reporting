#+title:  Weekly Report for 3rd May to 10th May 2021
#+author: Philip Herron
#+date:   2021-05-10

** Overview
Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

There was no change in the percentage progress for the milestone this week, but we are still on track to be finished by the end of the week. Several of the final tasks are mostly finished but fixes need some more cleanup and testing before they can be raised as PR's.

*** Monthly Community Call

We had our monthly community call for the project on zulip on 7th May 2021 at 10am UTC+1. You can find our meeting minutes: [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting/blob/main/2021-05-07-community-call.md][here]]

** Detailed changelog

*** Fix crash in parser with bad syntax

The parser had a crash when there was a space in between "+" and "=" which has be fixed with a simple null check from a new contributor: [[https://github.com/teromene][teromene]]

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn test() {
    let mut a = 1;
    a + = 1;
}
#+END_SRC

*** Stricter type checking

All implicit inference variables now get location info which is important for cases where a Path resolves to a generic impl item but the Self type cannot be inferred at that position. To get around this rust expects you to use a turbo fish to explicitly set the type parameter here.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
struct Foo<T>(T, bool);

impl<T> Foo<T> {
    fn test() -> i32 {
        123
    }
}

fn main() {
    let a = Foo::test();
    // { dg-error "type annotations needed" "" { target { *-*-* } } .-1 }
}
#+END_SRC

*** Fix crash when returning generic tuple

The compiler would crash when you return a generic tuple as it was missing some substitution checks.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn test<A,B>(a:A, b:B) -> (A,B) {
    (a,b)
}

fn main() {
    let a = test::<i32, i32>(123, 456);
    let b = test::<f32, f32>(123f32, 456f32);
}
#+END_SRC
