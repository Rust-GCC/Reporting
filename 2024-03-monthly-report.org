#+title:  Monthly Report for March 2024
#+author: Philip Herron, Pierre-Emmanuel Patry and Arthur Cohen
#+date:   2024-04-08

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Project update

This month saw another influx of new contributors as the start of GSoC approaches. This year looks to be very promising, with a lot of proposals received for the GCC project as a whole, and a lot of them being dedicated specifically to gccrs. 21 proposals were sent to the organization, which is similar to last year with 23 proposals. In the same vein, ~gccrs~ proposals totaled 7 submissions, compared to 8 last year.

The proposals we've read so far are of high quality and very well written. Our three mentors, Philip, Pierre-Emmanuel and Arthur, are reviewing them and will choose applicants in the next week or so.

The major news this month is the fast approaching release of GCC 14.1. We are hard at work, trying to fix as many bugs as possible and add as many features as we can before that deadline. We are excited for you to be able to try them out, and are looking forward to the numerous bug reports. As a reminder, ~gccrs~ will not be suitable for real use cases in its first release yet, and will still require you to pass additional options to ensure you understand the risks of using such an experimental compiler. We are thankful for all of the folks who will try our project out.

We have made last minutes changes to GCC's build system in order to improve the situation with our new dependency on Rust - the project will now error out early if you do not have Rust installed, so as to prevent this error happening down the line after 75% of the compilation of the project is done. This patch is currently being reviewed and will be upstreamed soon. After this, we will resume upstreaming the technical contributions we've made in the past two weeks or so.

These contributions concern the expansion of ~format_args!()~ macro invocations, as well as the expansion of ~for~-loops, both necessary for the ~println!()~ macro to be implemented. Pierre-Emmanuel has also made great progress on our name resolution rewrite in order to support glob imports, which were previously unhandled in the project. Finally, Jakub Dupak made further progress on the borrow checker, emitting more facts for the ~polonius-engine~ library and thus adding more and more infrastructure for more and more borrow-checking static analysis.

*** Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 15th of April at 10am UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar
to see when the next one will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just
like to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our [[https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust][mailing-list]] or join our [[https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com][Zulip chat]] to
be notified of upcoming events.
