** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

- More work on name resolution
- A *lot* of work on the build system to improve our dependency on Rust
  - Vendoring of our dependencies so we can build the project offline still
  - Improvements on detecting Rust
  - Improvements for not unconditionally linking libdl/libpthread on systems where it's not required
  - And more...
- 14.1 is closing in, RC probably next week according to Jakub
- Only a couple changes left and we're good to go
