#+title:  Monthly Report for September 2023
#+author: Philip Herron, Pierre-Emmanuel Patry and Arthur Cohen

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

We spent the majority of our time this month preparing patches, or fixing them after receiving reviews on the mailing lists. Some of these patches take a long time to upstream and review, as they touch common complex parts of the GCC project such as the build system, which we are currently fighting with to integrate a new ~libgrust~ folder containing various libraries useful to ~gccrs~, such as those related to our procedural macros implementation.
These patches are necessary to upstream before the rest of the work done this year, as intrinsic compiler features have been moved to this directory. Once this is done, we will be able to simply push the new patches upstream, after short modifications to make them more suitable to the upstream GCC project. At the moment, there are around 900 patches being prepared, with the hope of pushing them before the end of the month.
We are also exploring solutions to help automate this process a little more, as it represents very time consuming work which we would like to avoid in the future - keeping ~upstream~ up to date with our development repository, with weekly or bi-weekly updates, should prove worthwhile in the long term.

On the technical side, a lot of bugs were fixed this month again thanks to our contributor team. [[https://github.com/jdupak][Jakub Dupak]] has been making some amazing progress on borrow-checking in ~gccrs~, with the development of a new, simplified intermediate representation specifically designed to interact with the polonius borrow-checker. At the moment, our compiler can start emitting simple errors, such as "use after move" errors:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn test_move() {
    // this struct cannot be copied
    struct A {
        i: i32,
    }
    let a = A { i: 1 };

    let b = a; // first move
    let c = a; // second move occurs here
}
#+END_SRC

or simple lifetime analysis:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
// this errors out...
fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a usize) -> &'b usize {
    x // we can't know if x will live long enough, so this is an error
}

// ...but this is valid, since we specify that 'a must outlive 'b
fn foo2<'a, 'b>(x: &'a usize) -> &'b usize
    where 'a: 'b
{
    x
}
#+END_SRC

At the moment, errors are not yet formatted or displayed to the user, but the invalid behavior is caught and the compiler errors out. This work is extremely exciting, and we are looking forward to more progress from Jakub! Great work!

We also got in touch with the GCC release maintainers to understand what was expected of ~gccrs~ for it to be an integral part of the GCC 14.1 release, and should be able to fulfill the requirements (~println!()~ macro, simple Rust examples working...). We are very excited for everyone to be able to try the compiler.

Finally, October also saw Pierre-Emmanuel and Arthur go to EuroRust, where they had an amazing time. We are looking forward to coming back next year. We gave a small talk on the compiler, and the challenges of compiling the standard Rust library, which we will link to once released.

*** Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 13th of November 2023. You can subscribe to our calendar
to see when the next one will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just
like to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our [[https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust][mailing-list]] or join our [[https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com][Zulip chat]] to
be notified of upcoming events.
