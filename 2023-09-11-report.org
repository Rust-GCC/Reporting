  1. blogpost about their work will be published soon, currently being reviewed
  2. weeklies have been cancelled
2. Upstreaming started again!
  1. Patches missed due to GCC stage have been sent, waiting on reviews
  2. Now putting together "rebase file" with missing commits
  3. Will commit them to trunk soon (~next week)
3. Iterator support has been merged!
  1. For loops
  2. Functional iterators
4. Work on exporting proc macros by PE
5. Miguel Ojeda from RfL interested in gccrs progress and wants us to give a little report on close milestones

*** Milestones Progress

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 73% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
