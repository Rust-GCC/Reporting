#+title:  Weekly report for 17th of April 2023 to 24th of April 2023
#+author: Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

We received lots of pull-requests this week, with three new contributors joining the team. One of them led the effort to add a famous Rust easter egg. You can look at the pull-request and associated discussion in the list of ~Completed Activites~ below.

The work on ~libproc_macro~ is progressing steadily, with almost all of the required Rust types of the library implemented properly within our C++ library with the necessary FFI bridges. This will allow us to start experimenting with expansion of a procedural macro entirely within our system in the next couple of days.

The team spent a lot of time this week on a blogpost regarding the GCC 13.1 release, which we will soon publish.

We are going to keep working on some of the last big hurdles for complete AST expansion of ~libcore 1.49~: namely, this means handling glob imports and the ~#[path]~ attribute on modules, which are some of the last remaining tasks for this milestone. Furthermore, there are only a couple of issues left in [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/1895][our tracking issue for iterator support]], meaning that this complex abstraction will soon be entirely supported by ~gccrs~!

*** Overall Task Status

| Category    | Last Week | This Week | Delta |

| Completed   |       624 |       632 |    +8 |

*** Test Cases

The high amount of new testcases is due to the LTO testsuite issue mentioned in previous reports having been fixed by [[https://github.com/tschwinge][Thomas Schwinge]].

| TestCases | Last Week | This Week | Delta |

*** Milestones Progress

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 73% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.

*** Risks

** Planned Activities

- Finish work on iterators
- Look into glob use statements
- Look into builtin ~#[derive]~ macros
- Look into remaining issues required for proper AST pipeline of libcore
