** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

This week saw a lot of improvements to our codebase, with multiple refactors and cleanups of our type system and coercion logic from Philip. This will help ease the mental load when working on complex features, such as the support of Function traits (~FnOnce~, ~FnMut~ and ~Fn~) that Philip is currently adding. On the other hand, the const evaluation GSoC project is moving along nicely. The branch where that development happens is being prepped and rebased in order to merge it into our main branch shortly. Work also continue on compiler intrinsics and builtin functions.

As a reminder, we will be present at the Linux Plumbers Conference, Kangrejos and GNU Cauldron in September. Feel free to come and say hi!
