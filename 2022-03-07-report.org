#+title:  Weekly Report for 28th Feb to 7th March 2022
#+author: Philip Herron
#+date:   2022-03-07

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

We are in the final few weeks to close out declarative macros by the end of the month; this should be the last prominent feature required before compiling more of an older version of libcore. We should be roughly on time, maybe a few days out, but nothing significant stands out as a roadblock right now. I imagine we might move some of the built-in macros to be part of the builtins and intrinsics ongoing milestone since some of these may require more builtins such as panic!.

To keep on track with our aggressive timeline, we want to begin investigations into achieving our crate metadata exports with GCC since we have several options available to us, such as LTO streaming, CPP modules, or roll our own system such as GCCGO's .go_export section in object files with a simplified AST.

** Detailed changelog

*** must use attribute

To support must use, the GCC CPP front-end already supports the C++ nodiscard attribute which is analogus to rust must use attribute. Rust also supports using must use on types which we still need to test/support but this is the building block to support this on functions which discard their results.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
#[must_use = "TEST 1"]
fn test1() -> i32 {
    123
}

#[must_use = "TEST 2"]
fn test2() -> i32 {
    456
}

fn main() {
    let _a = test1();

    test2();
}
#+END_SRC

The error respects GCC -Wunused-result but this is turned on by default in the front-end.

#+BEGIN_SRC
<source>:14:5: warning: ignoring return value of 'example::test2', that must be used: 'TEST 2' [-Wunused-result]
   14 |     test2();
      |     ^
<source>:7:1: note: declared here
    7 | fn test2() -> i32 {
      | ^
#+END_SRC

*** Recursive macros using seperators

Macros can be recusive resulting in new macro invocations which need to be expanded. They also can have matchers which are like regular expressions in their matchers which require n-number of arguments delimited by a single matcher to terminate the sequence. This looks very similar to bison grammer files which is pretty impressive how expressive macros are in rust.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
macro_rules! add {
        ($e:expr | $($es:expr) | *) => {
            $e + add!($($es) | *)
        };
        ($e:expr) => {
            $e
        };
    }

fn test() -> i32 {
    add!(1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6)
}

#+END_SRC
