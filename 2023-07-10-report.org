** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

1. Lots of PRs this week! 22!
2. Lots of issues from our GSoC students
  1. Very good work
  2. Entering second phase of their projects, more exploratory and research
  3. Evaluations this week - both will pass!
3. Switching to the new GCC code of conduct
4. Merging work for new name resolution

*** Milestones Progress

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 73% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
