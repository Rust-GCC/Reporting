#+title:  Monthly Report for January 2023
#+author: Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

1. upstreaming patches. alsmost done!
2. Lots of things to think about: automation, changelogs, signoff lines...
3. Lots of pull-requests to review, lots of new contributors!
4. Lots of new code
5. GSoC applications
6. PE joined the team and started working on libproc!

We saw an influx of new contributors this month.

Most of the work this month was focused on fixing the reviews we received on the patches. We spent quite a lot of time organizing them differently, making the fixes, and then applying those fixes to the proper patches. The v4 of the patchset will be sent on the mailing list soon.

The compilation of libcore is still blocked by the same two issues: Macro importing and exporting, as well as closures. With the work on patches, we are finding very little time to add new features to the compiler but will get back to it as soon as possible.

We are still planning to complete these two issues as well as look at the ~#[derive]~ builtin macros.

We are also preparing abstracts in the hope of giving two talks at [[https://fosdem.org/2023/][FOSDEM]] in February. You should also expect a blog-post from us on the [[https://foundation.rust-lang.org/][Rust Foundation's website]] in the coming weeks.

As a side-note, Arthur will be on vacation the second half of December, starting on the 19th.

*** Milestones Progress

We are putting together milestones regarding projects such as libproc and will update the Milestone.

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 69% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
Similarly, the Update GCC's master branch milestone contains a [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/issues/1705][tracking issue]] containing over 200 tasks. The percentage shown here takes this into account.
