#+title:  Monthly Report for February 2023
#+author: Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen
#+date:   2023-03-13

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

The number of contributions this month stayed extremely important, with a lot of new
contributors and many existing contributors returning. The month of January, which was already
impressive with around 50 pull-requests merged, got supplanted by February, where we saw around
80 pull-requests from more than a dozen people get submitted and merged!

We hope that everyone has a nice time contributing to the project, but we are aware that there might still be some rough edges for new contributors. Please feel free to reach out to let us know what could be improved!

This month, Pierre-Emmanuel spent some more time getting our build system to handle the new
Rust libraries we will be bringing to the GCC project. He has also made significant strides on
multiple ~libcore~-related issues, namely on some features our parser lacked. Philip has spent
a lot of time on iterators and ~for~ loops, bringing us closer and closer to supporting all
of ~libcore 1.49~'s intricacies and internal mechanics. The handling of ~for~ loops requires
being able to compile a significant portion of ~libcore~, which we are really excited about.
Arthur spent some more time on name resolution and macros overall, finally bridging the gap
between macro exporting and our metadata exports, which allows us to start pulling in public
macros from external modules and crates.

Furthermore, the GCC project was accepted as a GSoC organization this year again. We have
put together 4 project proposals for ~gccrs~, for which you are welcome to submit a proposal! Philip and Arthur will be mentoring
applicants together.

You can find these project ideas [[https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SummerOfCode][here on the GCC wiki]], in the Rust frontend section.

You will be able to start submitting them on the 20th of March. In the meantime, feel free to
come chat with us on [[https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com][Zulip]] and discuss them, or talk about new project ideas. We are open to
all ideas, and are looking forward to your submissions!

Finally, ~gccrs~ will be present at Embedded World 2023 at the Embecosm booth. Feel free to come see us to chat about the project!

*** Community call

We had our monthly community call on the 6th of March. You can subscribe to our calendar
to see when the next one will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just
like to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our [[https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust][mailing-list]] or join our [[https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com][Zulip chat]] to
be notified of upcoming events.

*** Milestones Progress

We are putting together milestones regarding projects such as libproc and will update the Milestone.

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 69% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
Similarly, the Update GCC's master branch milestone contains a [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/issues/1705][tracking issue]] containing over 200 tasks. The percentage shown here takes this into account.

*** Risks

The last remaining risk was for gccrs to not get merged in GCC 13 by us missing the stage deadline, but that is no longer the case.

*** Testing project

The testing project is on hold as we try and figure out some of the issues we're running into with GitHub and our various automations around it.

** Planned Activities

- Finish patch upstreaming
- Finish macro name resolution
- libproc
- Iterators and Bugs
 
** Detailed changelog

*** Generic Argument bindings

Recently we add support for the binding associated types syntax in generic arguments such as:

#+BEGIN_SRC
core::ops::Add<Output = i32>>
#+END_SRC

This syntax of Output=xyz allows the arguments of an associated type bound set the expected associated types expected argument to be. This means when we do bounds checking we need to ensure that when bounds match not only are they coherent as in are they actually implemented as well as any parent trait bounds, but are their expected associated types ok. So for example you might do something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
mod core {
    mod ops {
        #[lang = "add"]
        pub trait Add<Rhs = Self> {
            type Output;

            fn add(self, rhs: Rhs) -> Self::Output;
        }
    }
}

impl core::ops::Add for f32 {
    type Output = f32;

    fn add(self, rhs: Self) -> Self::Output {
        self + rhs
    }
}

pub fn foo<T: core::ops::Add<Output = i32>>(a: T) -> i32 {
    a + a
}

pub fn main() {
    foo(123f32);
}
#+END_SRC

This test case shows that we expected foo to take an Add trait bound with an output of i32 but in main we are passing an f32 which obviously returns an f32 for its add output. Which results in this error:

#+BEGIN_SRC
<source>:25:9: error: expected 'i32' got 'f32'
   13 |     type Output = f32;
      |     ~~~~ 
......
   20 | pub fn foo<T: core::ops::Add<Output = i32>>(a: T) -> i32 {
      |               ~~~~
......
   25 |     foo(123f32);
      |         ^~~~~~
<source>:25:9: error: bounds not satisfied for f32 'Add' is not satisfied
   20 | pub fn foo<T: core::ops::Add<Output = i32>>(a: T) -> i32 {
      |               ~~~~
......
   25 |     foo(123f32);
      |         ^~~~~~
#+END_SRC
