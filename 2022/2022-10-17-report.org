#+title:  Weekly report for 3rd to 10th October 2022

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

We spent a lot of time this week working on some shortcomings of our type-system as well as trying to improve the macro name resolution and our pipeline overall. We also took the time to fix the early reviews that our patches received. Multiple contributors submitted PRs to improve our AST exporter, which will help a lot in the long run and make future tasks much easier!

We are in the middle of October, and are still accepting hacktoberfest contributions. As pointed out last week, mentoring requests are more than welcome. Feel free to start working on one of the issues marked `good-first-pr` or to join our [[https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com/][Zulip]] and ask for work.
