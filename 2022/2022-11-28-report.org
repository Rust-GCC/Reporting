#+author: Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

A lof of pull-requests for these last few weeks were dedicated to fixing the reviews received on the v3 of our patches. We are currently in the progress of splitting up the patchset into something more digestible for reviewers, which we hope will help upstreaming.

Two new contributors have decided to join the project since the last report, [[https://github.com/dme2][Dave Evans]] and [[https://github.com/tamaroning][Tamaron]]. Welcome and thank you!

*** Milestones Progress

We plan on adding more fine-grained milestones in between November and April as more themes of work will become apparent.

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 66% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
