#+title:  Monthly Report for September 2022
#+author: Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

We spent a lot of time traveling in September and thus achieve very little compared to other months in terms of features. However, we have gotten a lot of feedback from the various talks we gave and the discussions we attended, and feel the project has moved forward in many ways: what features we need to compile the Rust-for-Linux project, how to go about Rust versioning, the precautions we must take regarding upstreaming the compiler, our workflow, etc.

You can find the recordings of these events in the following section.

During the few days we were able to dedicate to compiler development, we've made some cleanups in the type system as well as started work on our missing macro features such as exporting.
