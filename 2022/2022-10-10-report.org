** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

This week we returned to a more usual level of productivity, and achieved a lot of work on the intrinsics side of things as well as our exporting mechanism. We spent some time fixing the early reviews we got from our upstream patches and are working on the next set of patches.

We have put together a planning for the foreseeable future of the project and would love to hear your thoughts about it: https://hackmd.io/@RebJtN4VQzOcP4MsOf8inA/SkjK2UOfs
Feel free to raise issues in the `gccrs` repository to discuss anything!

Finally, the project is also accepting hacktoberfest contributions and we would love to mentor anyone interested in contributing! Feel free to start working on one of the issues marked `good-first-pr` or to join our [[https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com/][Zulip]] and ask for work.
