** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

We sent out the v3 of our patches this week, which contain the same patches as our v2 with the issues addressed in early comments fixed. There is no new content in these patches, as we would like to get an early version reviwed fully and merged before.

A lot of time this week was also spent on our intrinsics, and especially atomic ones. We have put together a list of the intrinsics used in ~libcore-1.49~ and are working towards implementing them all.
Our AST Dump is also being improved greatly and cleaned up by [[https://github.com/jdupak][Jakub Dupak]], which will prove to be very helpful for finishing out macro exporting and importing.

We are on track to completing the ~Initial Upstream Patches~ milestone on time, with the last remaining blocker being proper macro name resolution.

*** Milestones Progress

We plan on adding more fine-grained milestones in between November and April as more themes of work will become apparent.

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 66% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
