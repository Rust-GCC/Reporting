#+title:  Weekly report for 17th to 24th October 2022

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

This week saw great improvements on a feature that had been previously unexplored: closures. For the past few weeks, Philip has been working tirelessly on handling the ~FnOnce~ trait as well as code generation for closures. This is now merged, with one issue remaining regarding variable capture. We have switched over our macro name resolution to a different logic, which should help with multiple things: macro exports/imports, proper macro resolution, and finally checks around specific macros such as ~asm!~. Our upstream patches have been fixed and split up when necessary, and are ready to being sent again as v3.

This is the last week of October and thus the last week of Hacktoberfest. The project is still accepting PRs and mentoring requests.

*** Milestones Progress

We plan on adding more fine-grained milestones in between November and April as more themes of work will become apparent.

We've also updated our "Initial upstream patches" deadline following one email on the GCC mailing list, stating that patch submissions needed to be posted for review before the 13th of November.
