#+title:  Weekly report for the 6th to the 13th of June 2022
#+author: Arthur Cohen
#+date: 2022-06-13

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

This week we saw major improvements in our name resolution pass, which got improved with many new features and refactored greatly. This is the result of a long standing issue regarding ~super~, ~crate~ and ~self~ paths, which Philip decided to tackle this week. On the other hand, Arthur worked on making an online dashboard, whose goal is to provide an easy way to view and track our progress using our [[github.com/rust-GCC/testing][testing project]]. The application will be unveiled as early as possible, once some more issues have been figured out.

Our GSoC students have done very good work integrating with the community and have started working on their respective projects. We are really excited to see what they'll produce and hope they'll have fun.

Philip will be on vacation for the next two weeks, taking some well-deserved rest in order to come back even stronger.

The ~Imports and Visibility~ milestone is in a reasonable state and we are starting work on the various ~const~ expressions and contexts we are expected to support. We are also moving away slightly from the "milestone" project model, as we would like to get closer and closer to compiling an earlier version of ~libcore~ this summer.

** Detailed changelog

*** ~super~ and ~crate~ path handling

Our name resolution and module handling components could previously not resolve complex relative paths such as ~crate::foo::bar~ or ~super::super::super::foo~. This is now fixed by adding proper module tree handling and improving our path resolution pass.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
mod a {
    pub fn foo() {}
}

mod b {
    pub fn foo() {
        // go UP in the hierarchy, then DOWN and DOWN
        super::a::foo();
    }
}

mod foo {
    pub struct bar(pub i32);
}

             // Go to the root of the module tree, then DOWN and DOWN
fn test() -> crate::foo::bar {
    foo::bar(123)
}
#+END_SRC
