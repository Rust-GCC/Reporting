#+title:  Weekly Report for 4th to 11th July 2022

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

In this past week, we have almost closed our imports and visibility. The missing piece is the automated tests using dejagnu. The LTO test suite has support for multiple objects linked together, but we need some tweaks to this and for this to be available regardless of LTO support. We could merge this and close out the milestone, but it's better to hold off and merge this with the automated tests; all the while, Arthur has been pushing forward with the const-generics milestone, along side Faisal Abbas who is porting over constexpr support from the CPP front-end.

** Completed Activities

- Porting more constexpr code [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/1350][PR1350]] [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/1356][PR1356]] [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/1369][PR1369]]
