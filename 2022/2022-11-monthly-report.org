#+title:  Monthly Report for October 2022
#+author: Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen
#+date:   2022-11-07

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

Most of the work this month was focused on fixing the reviews we received on the patches. We spent quite a lot of time organizing them differently, making the fixes, and then applying those fixes to the proper patches. The v4 of the patchset will be sent on the mailing list soon.

The compilation of libcore is still blocked by the same two issues: Macro importing and exporting, as well as closures. With the work on patches, we are finding very little time to add new features to the compiler but will get back to it as soon as possible.

We are still planning to complete these two issues as well as look at the ~#[derive]~ builtin macros.

We are also preparing abstracts in the hope of giving two talks at [[https://fosdem.org/2023/][FOSDEM]] in February. You should also expect a blog-post from us on the [[https://foundation.rust-lang.org/][Rust Foundation's website]] in the coming weeks.

As a side-note, Arthur will be on vacation the second half of December, starting on the 19th.

*** Milestones Progress

We have added milestones to better reflect the GCC merging cycle. More milestones will be put together as more themes of work are discovered along the year. We have closed out the ~Const Generics~ milestone, as it is in a sufficiently complete state for ~libcore-1.49~ compilation. Nonetheless, some const generics features are missing, and have been added to a separate ~Const Generics 2~ project.

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 66% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
