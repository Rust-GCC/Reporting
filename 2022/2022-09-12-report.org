#+title:  Weekly report for 5th to 12th September 2022
#+author: Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

We did not have a lot of time to spend on the compiler this week, as most of the time was taken by travelling to and attending [[https://kangrejos.com/][Kangrejos]]. The slides for our talk will soon be available on the website. We are also open to putting them directly on the repository as we have done in the past.

The main focus of this week is that Philip Herron and David Faust will be giving a talk about ~gccrs~ at the Linux Plumbers Conference on the Rust track. We are going to continue working on various intrinsics as well as improve our testing infrastructure.

** Completed Activities

- add testcase with struct to test component_ref and constructor codes in eval_constant_expression() [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/1528][PR1528]]
- backend: correctly formulate the exit condition [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/1526][PR1526]]
