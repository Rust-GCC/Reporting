** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

1. GSoC
  1. Strong students, very invested, asking good questions, submitting good pull requests
2. format_args!()
  1. First rust dependency is now added
3. what else?
4. Contributions are picking up
5. Upstream tooling is working good - two upstreams in three weeks, next one tomorrow/this week
  1. This enabled us to catch a couple bugs earlier than we would have
6. Get in touch with release maintainers regarding upcoming release
7. More borrow check work

We would like to remind our readers that Jakub Dupak, one of our contributors working on
integrating the ~polonius~ borrow-checker to gccrs, is currently finishing studying for his
Master's Degree and is looking for sponsorship to continue his work on the borrow checker.
Please get in touch if you or your company would be interested in funding his work!

*** Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 18th of March at 10am UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar
to see when the next one will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just
like to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our [[https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust][mailing-list]] or join our [[https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com][Zulip chat]] to
be notified of upcoming events.

** Call for contribution

This is a new section for particularly easy or interesting issues we would like folks external
to the project to contribute to. We are available for mentoring and guiding you on their
resolution. This is a great way to start making your mark on a complex project such as this
one and to learn a lot in the process!
