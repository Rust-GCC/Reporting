#+author: Philip Herron, Pierre-Emmanuel Patry, Arthur Cohen
#+date:   2026-01-12

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

- Wrote a nice report for the beginning of the year explaining what the goals are
- Focusing on the kernel for PE, focusing on core for Arthur
- Stubbing the kernel required core functions until core properly resolves
- Resuming upstreaming with the new year after the holiday break
