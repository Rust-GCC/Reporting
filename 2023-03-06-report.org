#+author: Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen
#+date:   2023-03-06

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

1. Still a lot of people
2. Getting really close to for loops! This is insane as there is a huge amount of code from libcore necessary to handle them
    1. Expect maybe a blogpost?
3. Macro exports is working! lots of things to clean up, but it's finally tackled it
4. good progress on ~libproc_macro~ and parsing issues
5. The GCC organization got accepted into Google Summer of Code, we are awaiting your proposals!
6. this report is written on the 2nd of March as Arthur will be on vacation

As a reminder, we published 4 project ideas for this year's Google Summer of
Code on GCC's wiki: https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SummerOfCode. You can see the list
of projects in the ~Rust frontend~ section. Feel free to reach out on Zulip if
you have any questions or would like to start putting together a proposal!

*** Milestones Progress

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 69% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
