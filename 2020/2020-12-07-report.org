* Week Starting 7th December 2020

With the feedback from both Philipp Krones and Bjorn3 (RustC backend developer) I have decided
it is better to start the refactoring process to get HIR (high-level IR) into GCC Rust. This is a big
change but it will be better to make this change now than 3-4 months from now. 

This change iis currently on a branch phil/hir-dev it reuses our AST as a baseline for the actual
IR data structures but with the idea the lowering process will remove macros and convert some statements
just as RustC does.

The architecture goal of this project is to bring the compiler more in line to how the offical rust
compiler works not nessecarily a clone but similar. The pipeline can now work as follows:

Parsing -> AST -> NameResolution -> Expand -> Lower-AST -> HIR -> TypeResolution -> GIMPLE

With the move to HIR it also brings about a much improved name resolution and type resolution process
the current algorithm was not going to work when it came to shadowing rules as well as the trait and
generics work down the road. https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/type-inference.html

** Planned Activities

Still targeting the core Data Structure Milestone

1. Raise PR for HIR-dev
   - Ensure no breakages with test suite
2. Attend Rust workshop and help out
3. Document the new architecture for the compiler
4. Still need to plan the GCC branch mirror
5. Finish reviews
