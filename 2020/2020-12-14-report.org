* Week 14th -> 21st December 2020

This week was a push to merge the new IR into the rust-frontend. This
was a major change but will make completeing the current milestone
of core data structures in rust much simpler. It also lays the ground
for handling generics later on.

Still on track for my milestone of core datastructures due Feb 1st.
