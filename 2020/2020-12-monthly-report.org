* Monthly Report for December 2020

Since November 23rd the feedback from rustc backend developer bjorn3
and Philipp Krones have been crucial in designing a proper architecture
for the compiler moving forward. The code was not going to be able to handle
to declare first, generics and traits uniformly. This first month a new HIR IR
has been added with a node ID mapping system akin to rustc which allows implementation
of the Hindley Milner type inferencing algorithm, which requires all nodes to be unified
with rules to determine types.

Consider declare first case we must examine all usages of the name x:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
let x; // inference varaible _
x = 1; // i32
#+END_SRC

Using type resolution rules it is possible to implement the following case.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
let mut x; // _
x = None;  // option<_>
x = 1;     // option<i32>
#+END_SRC

As part of this large re-architecture a new name and type resolver are in place which
have been designed with thoughs towards generics and traits down the line.

GCCRs is still on track to complete the Core Data structure milestone. For
this year of funding I believe the best usage of my time is to get onto implementing
generics and traits where the most complexity and unknowns lie for the compiler.
