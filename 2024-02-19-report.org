** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

1. Redone the milestones

1. Procedural Macros 2

Set the deadline as December 2024 - this enables us to finish adding some of the required features for Rust-for-Linux, which relies on a lot of procedural macros.

https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/rust-next/rust/macros

We need to add issues and testcases for each of the macros currently used by RfL as a baseline

2. Borrow checking 2

Finish all of borrow checking for GCC 15.1

3. GCC 14.1 milestone

All related issues are regarding upstream, missing documentation or other small fixes like this

*** Milestones Progress

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 73% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
