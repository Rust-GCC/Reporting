#+title:  Weekly report for the 9th to the 16th of May 2022
#+author: Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen
#+date:   2022-05-16

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

Once again, Philip spent a lot of time this week fixing various bugs in our type-system and generic resolution pass. We now have a cleaner, better interface with more functionality.
We also gained back support for 32-bit architectures by being more careful of the various types and print formats used in our middle-end. You can see track builds on various architectures [[https://builder.sourceware.org/][here]], and we plan to add these badges to our CI soon.
Thanks to [[https://github.com/bjorn3][bjorn3]] trying to compile a version of the core library using ~gccrs~ and reporting bugs, we also fixed some nasty bugs caused by undefined behavior. We are currently adding ~libcore-1.49~ as well as [[https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/blob/master/reference_impl/reference_impl.rs][the BLAKE3 reference Rust implementation]] to our testing project and tracking our progress on these test cases.
Thanks to our contributors, we are also gaining more pattern matching: [[https://github.com/dafaust][David Faust]] has worked on adding integers and chars, as well as ranges of those values, to the list of supported features, while [[https://github.com/antego][antego]] is currently working on supporting ~if let <pattern>~ constructs.
We also gained our first visibility lint, reporting errors about private functions being used outside of their visibility scope. This gives us a good base on which to add more lints and errors.

** Planned Activities

- Add more linting and restrictions to our privacy pass
- Continue bugfixing in aim of compiling our goal test case
- Continue work on metadata exports

** Detailed changelog

*** Match Expression

@dfaust

*** Bit shift operations cast

In rust arithmetic operations usually unify the types involved to resolve whats going on here. But bit shift operations are a special case where they actually cast their types.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn foo() -> u8 {
    1u8 << 2u32
}
#+END_SRC

*** Support casting integers to pointers

In embeded programming we often need to turn raw addresses into pointers. This required us to update our casting rules to support this.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
const TEST: *mut u8 = 123 as *mut u8;

fn test() {
    let a = TEST;
}
#+END_SRC

*** Privacy violations

All of the efforts regarding the privacy pass in the recent weeks have allowed us to have a solid privacy-reporting base. This will make it easy to report private items in public contexts, as well as have a variety of hints for good user experience.

This first implementation concerns functions and function calls.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust

mod orange {
    mod green {
        fn sain() {}
        pub fn doux() {}
    }

    fn brown() {
        green::sain(); // error: The function definition is private in this context
        green::doux();
    }
}
#+END_SRC

We also support ~pub(restricted)~ visibilities seamlessly thanks to the work done in the past few weeks regarding path resolution

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
mod foo {
    mod bar {
        pub(in foo) fn baz() {}
    }

    fn baz() {
        bar::baz(); // no error, foo::bar::baz is public in foo
    }
}
#+END_SRC
