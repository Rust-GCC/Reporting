** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

We are very happy to announce that two students have been selected for this year's Google Summer of Code: [[https://github.com/tamaroning][Raiki Tamura]] and [[https://github.com/MahadMuhammad/][Muhammad Mahad]]. Congratulations! We are super stocked to be working with you two, and are looking forward to your progress. We were very impressed with all of the proposals this year, and thank you all for your involvment - we hope you all apply again next year!
Muhammad will be working on improving our user errors, as well as integrating the official [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/error-index.html][Rust error codes]] to ~gccrs~, which will assist us greatly in passing the ~rustc~ testsuite in the coming months. Raiki, on the other hand, will be working on proper Unicode support for ~gccrs~: this involves changing to our lexer, parser, as well as the entire pipeline of the compiler.
We are super excited for this work to land and cannot wait to tell you more about their progress!

We received a high number of contributions related to macro expansion and the AST pipeline in general, some of which have fixed very long standing bugs which is really nice to see. Builtin derive macros are being implemented, with a base framework enabling more contributors to join this effort if interested. This work also helps [[https://github.com/P-E-P][Pierre-Emmanuel Patry]]'s work on custom procedural macros, which is progressing nicely and has started looking at the finer details of binary interfaces between procedural macros and the compiler.

We also had our community call on the 15th of May, for which you can find notes [[https://hackmd.io/X_hMaXkVRP-f6tZhmthgNQ][here]]. Stay tuned for the next one, which should happen at the beginning of June.

*** Milestones Progress

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 73% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.

*** Risks

**FIXME**:

** Planned Activities
