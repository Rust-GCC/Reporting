#+title:  Monthly Report for June 2023
#+author: Philip Herron and Arthur Cohen

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

The number of contributions increased this month with over 50 pull requests merged in [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs][~gccrs~]] from eight contributors and a couple more in our various tooling projects, as well as valuable input on our different platforms, which remains a tremendous help in the development of this compiler.
Our two Google Summer of Code students, [[https://github.com/MahadMuhammad][Mahad Muhammad]] and [[https://github.com/tamaroning][Raiki Tamura]], are progressing quickly on their projects and submitting high quality contributions - we are getting more and more of Rust's error codes integrated to our compiler, which will assist us in trying to pass the ~rustc~ testsuite, and our lexer is slowly but surely becoming Unicode compliant with a high number of unit tests to boot.
Their mid-term evaluations will start next week, and we are excited to enter the second phase of their projects, where more technical contributions will come in: v0 name mangling and punycode support for [[https://github.com/tamaroning][Raiki Tamura]], and internal GCC cleanups for the error emitting code for [[https://github.com/MahadMuhammad][Mahad Muhammad]].

One unforeseen hurdle this month was the need for a complete rework of our name resolution pass. Name resolution in Rust is a complex process, which should be divided in two passes. In ~gccrs~, name resolution was developed before macro expansion, meaning that macro name resolution was not taken into account properly. This is now starting to cause issues as we try and fix the last few remaining bugs around imports, macro exports and early name resolution in general for the compilation of ~core~ 1.49. We have spent a lot of time trying to improve the existing name resolution algorithms to stry and split them in two (or more) distinct passes, but this is proving to be a difficult task. Furthermore, it is an area of the compiler which deserves a little more attention, and has not been improved much since its creation. Philip and Arthur took the decision to rewrite this pass of the compiler, aiming for simpler data structures, simpler algorithms and less global state, making the name resolution pass a three-pass process: ~TopLevel~ name resolution, ~Early~ name resolution and ~Late~ name resolution.
The ~TopLevel~ pass is in charge of collecting definitions for the entire program, as Rust allows you to call a function defined later in the source. ~Early~ takes care of macro name resolution and imports, and works in a fixed point fashion with ~TopLevel~. Finally, ~Late~ is your "classical" name resolution pass, and resolves functions, types and variables.

We are mostly done with the data structures and are in the process of merging them to our compiler. We now need to write the missing visitors and name resolution 2.0 will be complete.

In our typesystem, Philip spent a lot of time chasing some of the few remaining bugs needed for handling iterators. Most of the fixes are now one-line fixes, which is quite disheartening, but also an indication that we are getting closer and closer!

We are also in the process of welcoming [[https://github.com/jdupak][Jakub Dupak]]'s Master thesis project, which will be focused on adding support for the Polonius borrow checker to ~gccrs~. This exciting work should start in the upcoming months.

*** Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 10th of July 2023. You can subscribe to our calendar

*** Milestones Progress

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 73% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
Similarly, the Update GCC's master branch milestone contains a [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/issues/1705][tracking issue]] containing over 200 tasks. The percentage shown here takes this into account.

*** Testing project

The testing project is on hold as we try and figure out some of the issues we're running into with GitHub and our various automations around it.

** Planned Activities

- Name resolution v2.0
- Fix remaining type systems bugs for ~core~ 1.49
- Look at procedural macro name resolution

** Detailed changelog
