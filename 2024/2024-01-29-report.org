** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

1. Fixes for bugs reported upstream again, specifically for line endings which we need special machinery for as dejagnu does not handle them properly
  1. Commits since December/January will be upstreamed this week as well
2. More parser fixes, more work from new contributors
3. Improved borrow-checking framework
4. Need to figure out GSoC 2024 projects
  1. Borrow checking?
  2. Inline assembly?
  3. Soundness testing harness?
  4. Adapting the rustc testsuite to use our new error code framework?
5. Work on establishing the format_args!() milestone properly

** Completed Activities

*** Milestones Progress

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not representative: It shows a 73% completion rate, but does not take into account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items.
Thus the percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall.
