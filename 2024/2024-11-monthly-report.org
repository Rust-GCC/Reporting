** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Project update

GCC development entered stage 3 this month, meaning that ~gccrs~ is no longer allowed to submit patches that affect the entire GCC framewrok until the project re-enters stage 1, after the release of GCC 15.1. This is not an issue for us, as we took special care to send the affected patches upstream back in June of this year, giving them plenty of time to get reviewed and merged before stage 3. In other GCC news, the baseline for building the compiler got bumped from GCC 4.8 to GCC 5.4 - this means that the oldest compiler that we are expected to target is newer and adds support for C++14. Thanks to [[https://github.com/thesamesam][Sam James]] and [[https://github.com/dkm][Marc Poulhiès]], we have updated our CI to reflect this change. Thank you both!

Most of the pull-requests this month were focused on name resolution, with even more improvements made by [[https://github.com/powerboat9][Owen Avery]]. Owen has been a contributor to the project for two years, and has been extremely helpful recently with our name resolution rewrite (NR2.0), by working on integrating it to all areas of the compiler. We will thus be welcoming Owen to the core ~gccrs~ team of contributors.

An interesting technical change this month concerns the type-checking of ~match~ expressions. In one certain case, ~match~ expressions can resolve to the ~never~ type. This is interesting for empty ~enum~s, which can be used to represent invalid or impossible states. A well known type from the standard library is [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/enum.Infallible.html][Infallible]], whose definition is as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
enum Infallible {}
#+END_SRC

Since this ~enum~ does not contain any variants, matching on it looks a bit strange:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn handle_infallible(x: Infallible) {
    let y = match x {};
}
#+END_SRC

In that case, what should the type of ~y~ be? Since we cannot extract any information from ~x~, it doesn't really make sense to give ~y~ a regular type. Furthermore, since we cannot instantiate a value of type ~Infallible~ in the first place, it does not make sense to do pattern-matching on it to extract information! But by making this pattern matching resolve to the ~never~ type, we can implement traits on ~Infallible~ in order to use it just like a regular error type - since ~never~ can always coerce to any target type, as it cannot exist in the first place. This makes empty pattern matching required for handling the ~Infallible~ type and its trait implementations, which is required for handling code that can never fail. The documentation of the ~enum~ gives an interesting example, in which the ~TryFrom<T>~ trait can be implemented for ~U~ when ~U~ already implements ~From<T>~. Because we know the conversion can never fail, there is no need to expose a proper error type, as those errors will never show up.

The fix for this is quite simple - if the ~match~ we are type-checking is empty, then we can just resolve its type to ~never~. If the match is not supposed to be empty (for example, if we are matching on an ~enum~ with one or more variants), then it's up to the exhaustiveness checker to report an issue - not the type-checker!

If you are curious, you can see how this special case is handled in [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/afbd87358cc8b4627536145510b0c17634005eb6/gcc/rust/typecheck/rust-hir-type-check-expr.cc#L1461-L1468][gccrs]] and in [[https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3d1dba830a564d1118361345d7ada47a05241f45/compiler/rustc_hir_typeck/src/_match.rs#L32-L36][rustc]].

In other technical news, [[https://github.com/antoyo][Antoni Boucher]], lead developer of the ~rustc_codegen_gcc~ project, contributed code to ~gccrs~ this month in order to improve target feature detection for both of our projects. This code concerns platform-specific information that the compilers needs to know about in order to produce correct assembly. By reusing the same code in both projects, we ensure that Rust code compiled using one of the GCC-based compilers will behave the same way on the users' machines. This change also makes it easier to adapt our target configuration values for Rust if the need arises. Thank you Antoni!

Finally, a blogpost written in collaboration with the Rust project was also published on the official Rust blog: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/11/07/gccrs-an-alternative-compiler-for-rust.html. This blogpost outlines some of the decisions we've made for ~gccrs~ to make sure that the project does not threaten the Rust ecosystem and does not risk splitting it in two. The main discussion thread about it can be found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1gm51ki/gccrs_an_alternative_compiler_for_rust_rust_blog/][here on Reddit]], where it was really well-received.

*** Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 9th of December at 10am UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our [[https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust][mailing-list]] or join our [[https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com][Zulip chat]] to be notified of upcoming events.

** Call for contribution

There are no calls for contribution this month, as we do not have a lot of good first issues available. Still, feel free to take a look at them [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-pr][here]] and get in touch with us for some mentoring or help!

*** Risks

We have now entered Stage 3 of GCC development, and all of the patches we needed to get upstreamed have been upstreamed. The risk present in this table is no longer present.
