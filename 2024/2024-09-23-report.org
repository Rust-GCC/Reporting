** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

- Two new interns have done their first week + links and names
- Blogpost for rust-lang.org is 99% done, requires an extra sub-blogpost on rust-gcc.github.io which is being written
  - will be finished shortly, purely technical
  - should we publish it somewhere else?
- Fix build on Windows hopefully, but still not in CI
- New test system for name resolution 2.0
