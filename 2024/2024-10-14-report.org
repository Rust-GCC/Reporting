** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

- We're working on reducing the gap between first and second name resolution.
  - New test system for name resolution 2.0 works great

** Completed Activities

- Improve InlineAsmOperand [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/3193][PR3193]]
- Handle TypeAlias during toplevel resolution 2.0 [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/3192][PR3192]]
- Check for writes outside of the build directory [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/2974][PR2974]]
- Fix some issues with canonical path fetching in name resolution 2.0 [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/3190][PR3190]]
- Improve Rib::Definition shadowing [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/3188][PR3188]]
- Insert static items into the value namespace [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/3194][PR3194]]
