** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

- Parser fixes
- Build system patch upstreamed, fixed
  - Upstreaming will resume this week to bring trunk up to date with our dev repo
- Inline assembly parsing is going great
  - One bug in macro expansion fixed as a result
  - now work on adding various analysis passes to inline assembly will start, and then codegen
