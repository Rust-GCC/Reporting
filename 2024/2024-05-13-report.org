** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

- Very short last week for gccrs
- Progress on milestones document: https://hackmd.io/pJQAETRsSym8KG0TFuSnhw
- Creation of a GCC 14.2 milestone as well, even though it will be small
- The goal is to have smaller milestones with shorter deadlines
- I am hoping this will help make the progress more apparent
- GSoC weekly syncups are starting this week, will be creating project milestones for all 3

** Completed Activities

- Remove unnecessary SIDE_EFFECTS/READONLY macros               [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/2977][PR2977]]
- Rework hir map to make it's API more confortable to work with [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/2969][PR2969]]
- Removed obsolete objects                                      [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/2968][PR2968]]
- Borrowck tests and build                                      [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/2889][PR2889]]
