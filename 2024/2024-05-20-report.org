** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

- Progress on milestones document: https://hackmd.io/pJQAETRsSym8KG0TFuSnhw
- Spent a lot of time identifying issues with ~core~, identified some nice milestones out of them
  - e.g. error propagation
- Starting work on recently identified parser issues for ~std~ and ~Rust-for-Linux~
- GSoC weekly syncups are ongoing, nice progress from all students who wish to start their work early
  - https://hackmd.io/6SSc3kzfSCa-KuzrOt3FCQ
  - https://hackmd.io/nHlmHFfARIe1AIau4hh6Eg
  - https://hackmd.io/pQDae4c4SQS_kvm4Y2u1HA
  - Most of the work for now is exploratory and research-y.
  - This will help establish milestones for the projects.
