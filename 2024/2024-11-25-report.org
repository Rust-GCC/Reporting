** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

- Now in stage 3
- Git repo update underway
- Getting ready to upstream again with even fewer issues this time around
- Massive rework of how the repo is organized which will help with maintaining an out-of-tree fork
- Lots of time spent on updating our github fork, which is not productive and needs to improve
- More name resolution fixes and type system fixes

** Completed Activities

- ci: remove bors mention                                             [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/3263][PR3263]]

- Prevent execution of some nr1.0 functions with nr2.0                [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/3257][PR3257]]
- gccrs: empty match expressions should resolve to !                  [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/3256][PR3256]]
- Add a new CI step to detect raw issue references in commit messages [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/3255][PR3255]]
- Handle type path segments during late resolution 2.0                [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/3254][PR3254]]
- Use nr2.0 in typechecker                                            [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/3253][PR3253]]
- Use nr2.0 in `PrivacyReporter`                                      [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/3252][PR3252]]
