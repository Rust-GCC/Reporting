** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

- Upstreaming will resume this week to bring trunk up to date with our dev repo
- Macro expansion fixes
- Good progress for all GSoC projects
- We are starting work on some type system fixes, specifically around ~for-loops~
  - Indexing fixes
  - Iterator fixes
  - These two milestones should go on for most of the summer

** Completed Activities

- Emit error on optional supertraits                [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/3055][PR3055]]
- expand: Keep track of semicoloned builtin macros  [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/3054][PR3054]]
