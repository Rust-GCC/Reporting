** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

- Lots of PRs in the reviewing queue, but very busy
- No reviews for 14.2 patches, will probably end up in 15.1 which is fine
- GSoC midterm evaluations
  - All students passed with flying colors
  - Really happy with their work
  - Need to spend a little more time this week reviewing their work as they've been working mostly autonomously the past two weeks
- Milestones are all on track so far
- Pierre Emmanuel working on name resolution, Arthur on lang items paths
- Soon the typesystem work will start, regarding ~for~ loops

** Completed Activities

- Pin node16 by allowing old version            [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/3081][PR3081]]
- Remove unnecessary #include from rust-expr.h  [[https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/pull/3077][PR3077]]

*** Contributors this week

- [[https://github.com/liamnaddell][Liam Naddell]] (new contributor!)
