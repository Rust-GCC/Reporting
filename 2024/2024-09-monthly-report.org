** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Project update

We released a [[https://rust-gcc.github.io/2024/09/20/reusing-rustc-components.html][technical blogpost]] this month concerning the current and future integration of Rust components in ~gccrs~, and how they can help us speed-up the compiler's development, while making it more correct. We have also finished writing the rust-lang blogpost, and have gone through a 

- Technical update on integrating rustc components: __NOTE: Add link__
- Blogpost done
- Work on typechecker issues, will help for for-loops
- Another month with lots of technical contributions
- Great conversations at RustConf
- Lots of improvements to our CI, which helps with upstreaming
  - which has resumed
- Technical updates:
  - Name resolution
  - Lang items

- Foundation
- Technical blogpost which was well received

This month saw really good progress in terms of the number of merged PRs, issues completed, and testcases added. All three Google Summer of Code projects got completed, which required extensive reviewing. Our three students passed the final evaluation brillantly, and are all interested in continuing to contribute to the compiler in their free time. We are very happy to have them join the team, and are looking forward to their future work. We have offered to help mentor them in the future, as well as to help with any compiler-related studies they might have. As a reminder, anyone interested in contributing to the project will be able to receive similar help and mentoring.

In fact, we are currently working with another student outside of GSoC to put together a testsuite and testing program which will help us assert that ~gccrs~ produces code with correct semantics (as a reminder, correct means "with ~rustc~'s semantics"). It is important for ~gccrs~ to only accept the correct subset of code, but it is also necessary that the assembly we produce has the same meaning and the same runtime characteristics as any other Rust program. This ties into our pursuit of producing a "correct" compiler, which we'll talk about more in a future blogpost in cooperation with the Rust project.

In terms of technical contributions, we have closed the ~Unhandled attributes~ milestone, which covered the handling of all attributes required for compiling ~core 1.49~. We have made good progress on the ~Lang items~ milestone, with the only remaining step being to switch our existing code generation of lang item paths to these new paths we introduced. This will help all of our early code generation pipeline, namely surrounding built-in macros and the desugaring of certain constructs like ~for~ loops. Once this is done, we will fix the issues surrounding iterators and indexing, which currently prevent ~for~ loops from being completely implemented. We have gained a few new contributors this summer, and we hope that this trend continues. We hope they continue to contribute to the project, and will spend some time this week to try and help with the codebase when necessary. For a look at the work we plan on doing this year, check out [[https://rust-gcc.github.io/2024/09/03/towards-gcc15.1.html][the engineering document we established a few months ago]]

Finally, we would like to be more public about ~gccrs~'s progress. In some recent comments surrounding the Rust-for-Linux project, we have noted that some internauts believe that the work on the compiler has slowed down, despite our regular upstreaming and progress reports. We think this might be due to a lack of activity on social media and forums such as Reddit or HackerNews, and will start posting our monthly updates there again. We will also be coming out with a few blogposts in the coming weeks, namely around the progress achieved by our GSoC students and how it will impact users.

*** Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 12th of August at 9am UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar
to see when the next one will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just
like to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our [[https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust][mailing-list]] or join our [[https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com][Zulip chat]] to
be notified of upcoming events.

** Call for contribution

- [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/3001][Issue 3001: Generic arguments are not disambiguated on error propagation expressions]]

Our error propagation expressions (expressions which use the question mark operator, of the form ~<expr>?~) are currently forgotten in many of our AST visitors. As a result, there are unexpected cases when it comes to various parts of the compiler pipeline handling them. In that particular case, the function call's generic arguments are not disambiguated - the compiler does not know if it needs to be handling a generic type, or a const generic value. You will need to add handling to our name resolution pass for these error propagation expressions. It would be helpful to look at [[https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/75049a3bfee8c3f888994bce3b741a805c631c2a/gcc/rust/resolve/rust-ast-resolve-type.cc#L568][the current generic disambiguation]] to start figuring out where it is called from, and where you need to call it.
