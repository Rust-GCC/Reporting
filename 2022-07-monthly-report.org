#+title:  Monthly Report for July 2022

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

July saw a lot of news for GCC Rust, prominently the aproval to merge upstream into GCC 13. This is seen as part of the development process for us in ensuring we are handling copyright approval and coding standards properly for GCC. The first patch set has already been reviewed, and there is work for us to start splitting up our front-end into a buildable patch set which will form version two of the patch set. I will be extracting each compiler pass into a separate patch starting with:

- Skeleton front-end for rust
- AST structures
- Lexer and Parser (might be split up)
- Expansion pass
- Name resolution pass
- HIR IR and lowering pass
- Type resolution pass
- Deadcode pass
- Unsafe pass
- GCC Generic code-generation and constexpr code
- Smaller lints like unused var
- Metadata output
- Compiler driver update
- Testsuite

This is a lot of work to split up and ensure each component is buildable, but between Arthur and Faisal, our google summer of code student, we can keep moving forward each week.

*** Unsafe checks

One important feature that we hadn't implemented so far in the compiler was the check for unsafe code. This is a core feature of Rust, as a lot of operations permitted by other languages may prove dangerous and need some extra consideration. These limitations include the dereferencing of raw pointers, calls to unsafe or extern functions, accessing a union's member or using certain kinds of static variables (and more). However, these behaviors are necessary in certain situations, in which case they need to be wrapped in ~unsafe~ blocks or functions.

~gccrs~ will now error out as expected from Rust programs in the following situations:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
unsafe fn unsafoo() {}

static mut GLOBAL: i32 = 15;

fn bar(value: i32) {}

fn foo() {
    unsafoo(); // call to unsafe function!

    let a = 15;
    let b = &a as *const i32; // this is allowed

    let c = *b; // this is unsafe!

    bar(*b); // here as well!

    let d = GLOBAL; // this is unsafe as well!
}
#+END_SRC

You can follow our progress in adding unsafe checks on this [[https://github.com/rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/1411][tracking issue]] on our repository.

*** Linking crates

In Rust, the entire crate is the compilation unit; for reference, a compilation unit is often referred to as the translation unit in GCC. This means, unlike other languages, a crate is built up with multiple source files. This is all managed by the mod keywords in your source code, such that mod foo will expand automatically to the relative path of foo.rs and include the source code akin to an include nested within a namespace in C++. This has some exciting benefits, notably no need for header files, but this means more complexity because, when linking code, the caller needs to know the calling conventions and type layout information.

To support linking against crates, many things come together to let it happen, so let us look at this by considering a simple example of calling a function in a library. Let us assume we have a library foo with directory structure:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
// libfoo/src/lib.rs
fn bar(a:i32) -> i32 {
  a + 2
}
#+END_SRC

We can compile this by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  gccrs -g -O2 -frust-crate=foo -c src/lib.rs -o foo.o
#+END_SRC

This will generate your expected object file, but you will notice a new output in your current working directory: foo.rox. This is your crate metadata; it contains all this "header" information, such as functions and type layouts. There is code to this by embedding this metadata directly into the object file, which will be preserved into static libraries, and the compiler will support reading from object files and archives but not shared objects, unfortunately. However, by emitting this separate file, it means its output format is agnostic as this method does not seem to be supported for us on macosx.

Back to the example, in order to link against this object and call the function, we must write code to import it:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
// test/src/main.rs
extern crate foo;
use foo::bar;

fn main() {
  let a = bar(123);
}
#+END_SRC

Now to compile and link this.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  gccrs -g -O2 -I../libfoo -c src/main.rs -o main.o
  gccrs -o test main.o ../libfoo/foo.o
#+END_SRC

In the compiler, we see the extern crate declaration, which tells the compiler to look for the external crate foo, which in turn triggers the compiler to look for foo.rox, foo.o or libfoo.a in this case, we will find foo.rox. The front-end loads this data, so we know there is a function named bar. Internally the crate of foo just exports:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
extern "Rust" {
  fn bar(a:i32) -> i32;
}
#+END_SRC

This is more complicated for generics and impl blocks, but the idea is the same. The benefit of exporting raw rust code here is that to support public generics, we just get this for free by reusing the same compiler pipeline.

Note you can use the following options to control this metadata output so far:

- -frust-embed-metadata this toggles to embed the metadata into .rust_export section of the target asm output default off
- -frust-metadata-output= specifies the path to directly write the metadata to file

Note 1: that when specifying the location to write this metadata file the compiler will enforce a naming convention of crate_name.rox on the basename of the path as the crate name is critical here.
Note 2: this link model is heavily inspired as that from gccgo.
